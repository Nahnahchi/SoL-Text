<text id="1000">Yes, indeed.</text>
<text id="1001">The Darksign brands the Undead.</text>
<text id="1002">And in this land,</text>
<text id="1003">the Undead are corralled and led to the north,</text>
<text id="1004">where they are locked away, to await the end of the world.</text>
<text id="1005">...This is your fate.</text>
<text id="2000">Only, in the ancient legends it is stated,</text>
<text id="2001">that one day an Undead shall be chosen</text>
<text id="2002">to leave the Undead Asylum, in pilgrimage,</text>
<text id="2003">to the land of the Ancient Lords,</text>
<text id="2004">Lordran.</text>
<text id="3000">What foolishness...</text>
<text id="3001">Why trespasseth upon the Great Lord's tomb, whilst thou art a
disciple of the Dark Sun?</text>
<text id="3002">Mark the words of mineself, Gwyndolin!</text>
<text id="3003">Thou shalt not go unpunished!</text>
<text id="4000">What foolishness...</text>
<text id="4001">Why would a Blade of the Darkmoon trespasseth upon the Great
Lord's tomb?</text>
<text id="4002">Mark the words of mineself, Gwyndolin!</text>
<text id="4003">Thou shalt not go unpunished!</text>
<text id="10000000">He has the key.</text>
<text id="10000001">The choice is yours.</text>
<text id="10010100">Ah, hello!</text>
<text id="10010101">I knew you would come! Just call it intuition.</text>
<text id="10010102">Ah, hello! You don't look Hollow, far from it!</text>
<text id="10010103">I am Solaire of Astora, an adherent of the Lord of Sunlight.</text>
<text id="10010104">Now that I am Undead, I have come to this great land, the
birthplace of Lord Gwyn, to seek my very own sun!</text>
<text id="10010105">...Do you find that strange? Well, you should!</text>
<text id="10010106">No need to hide your reaction. I get that look all the time!</text>
<text id="10010107">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="10010200">Oh, ah-hah! So, I didn't scare you?</text>
<text id="10010201">I have a proposition, if you have a moment.</text>
<text id="10010250">The way I see it, our fates appear to be intertwined.</text>
<text id="10010251">Both Undead, both imprisoned in the Asylum, and now, we both end
up here.</text>
<text id="10010252">In a land brimming with Hollows, could that really be mere
chance?</text>
<text id="10010253">I hardly think so!</text>
<text id="10010254">Now, I know not of your designs, but I sense something singular
about you.</text>
<text id="10010255">So, what do you say? Why not help one another on this lonely
journey?</text>
<text id="10010300">Oh, yes! Wonderful!</text>
<text id="10010301">This pleases me greatly! Well then, take this.</text>
<text id="10010302">We are amidst strange beings, in a strange land.</text>
<text id="10010303">The flow of time itself is convoluted; with heroes centuries old
phasing in and out.</text>
<text id="10010304">The very fabric wavers, and relations shift and obscure.</text>
<text id="10010305">There's no telling how much longer your world and mine will
remain in contact.</text>
<text id="10010306">But, use this,</text>
<text id="10010307">to summon one another as spirits, cross the gaps between the
worlds,</text>
<text id="10010308">and engage in jolly co-operation!</text>
<text id="10010309">Of course, we are not the only ones engaged in this.</text>
<text id="10010310">But I am a warrior of the sun! Spot my summon signature easily by
its brilliant aura.</text>
<text id="10010311">If you miss it, you must be blind!</text>
<text id="10010312">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="10010350">Well, yes, quite understandable.</text>
<text id="10010351">Not to worry. Let there be no obligation.</text>
<text id="10010352">Not to worry. I do not wish to impose.</text>
<text id="10010353">I was in the wrong. We'll laugh it off, shall we?</text>
<text id="10010354">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="10010400">Oh, hello there. I will stay behind, to gaze at the sun.</text>
<text id="10010401">The sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father!</text>
<text id="10010402">If only I could be so grossly incandescent!</text>
<text id="10010500">Oh, hello. You're still keen on speaking to me?</text>
<text id="10010501">Then, perhaps you have reconsidered my offer?</text>
<text id="10010600">Hrg!</text>
<text id="10010610">Ooh!</text>
<text id="10010620">Whoa!</text>
<text id="10010630">What the...!</text>
<text id="10010640">What's wrong with you?!</text>
<text id="10010700">If a stubborn beast you be, I have no choice!</text>
<text id="10010701">A Warrior of the Sun will not just sit and take it!</text>
<text id="10010702">Hrgraaah!</text>
<text id="10010800">Why, you...</text>
<text id="10010801">How could this...?</text>
<text id="10010802">My...my sun...</text>
<text id="10020000">Oh, there you are.</text>
<text id="10020001">You've been quiet these days.</text>
<text id="10020002">Smooth summoning out there?</text>
<text id="10020003">Anytime you see my brilliantly shining signature, do not hesitate
to call upon me.</text>
<text id="10020004">You've left me with quite an impression. I would relish a chance
to assist you.</text>
<text id="10020100">You really are fond of chatting with me, aren't you?</text>
<text id="10020101">If I didn't know better, I'd think you had feelings for me!</text>
<text id="10020102">Oh, no, dear me. Pretend you didn't hear that!</text>
<text id="10020103">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="10020200">Oh, hello there.</text>
<text id="10020201">I'm glad to see you alive.</text>
<text id="10020202">...You have done well, indeed you have.</text>
<text id="10020203">You've a strong arm, strong faith, and most importantly, a strong
heart.</text>
<text id="10020204">I am in awe, really.</text>
<text id="10020205">Yes, yes...</text>
<text id="10020206">What do you think? Why not join me, as a warrior of the Sun?</text>
<text id="10020207">Righteous knights, guardians of all that is good, in the name of
the Lord of Sunlight!</text>
<text id="10020208">...Only if it would please you, of course. Well?</text>
<text id="10020250">Oh! Magnificent! I knew you would fancy it!</text>
<text id="10020251">Then, join the Covenant! Here, stay still for a moment...</text>
<text id="10020252">And there we are. Now you need only pray at the Altar of Sunlight
in Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="10020253">And there we are. Now, just say a prayer at the Altar of
Sunlight, right there.</text>
<text id="10020254">Then you shall know our radiance, our duty.</text>
<text id="10020255">Then you shall know the brilliance of our Sun.</text>
<text id="10020300">Yes, well, each has one's beliefs.</text>
<text id="10020301">But if you change your mind, the offer is open.</text>
<text id="10020400">Oh, hello there. Still here?</text>
<text id="10020401">You have praying to do. At the Shrine of Sunlight in Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="10020402">I could not hope for a braver companion than you!</text>
<text id="10020403">But truly, I could not hope for a braver companion than you!</text>
<text id="10020404">Gah hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="10020500">Oh, hello there.</text>
<text id="10020501">What is it? Have you changed your mind about my offer?</text>
<text id="10020600">Hmm! Ah, oh...hello there.</text>
<text id="10020601">Forgive me, I was just pondering...about my poor fortune.</text>
<text id="10020602">I did not find my own sun, not even in Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="10020603">I did not find my own sun, not in Anor Londo, nor in Twilight
Blighttown.</text>
<text id="10020604">Where else might my sun be? Lost Izalith, or the Tomb of the
Gravelord...?</text>
<text id="10020605">But I cannot give up. I became Undead to pursue this!</text>
<text id="10020606">But when I peer at the Sun up above, it occurs to me...</text>
<text id="10020607">What if I am seen as a laughing stock, as a blind fool without
reason?</text>
<text id="10020608">Well, I suppose they wouldn't be far off!</text>
<text id="10020609">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="10020700">Oh, hello there.</text>
<text id="10020701">Exhilarating, is it not? The power of the Sun!</text>
<text id="10020702">I am blessed to have found such a brave companion!</text>
<text id="10020703">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="10030000">...Hrg, rg...Arrrgh...</text>
<text id="10030001">...Finally, I have found it, I have!...</text>
<text id="10030002">...My very own sun...I...am the sun!...</text>
<text id="10030003">...I've done it...I have...</text>
<text id="10030004">...Yes, I did it...I did!...</text>
<text id="10030005">...Ohh, ohhh...</text>
<text id="10030006">...Hrgrraaaooogh!...</text>
<text id="10030100">...Ahh, it's over...</text>
<text id="10030101">...My Sun...it's setting...</text>
<text id="10030102">...It's dark, so dark...</text>
<text id="10040000">...Why?...Why?...</text>
<text id="10040001">After all this searching, I still cannot find it...</text>
<text id="10040002">Was it all a lie? Have I done this all, for nothing?</text>
<text id="10040003">Oh, my dear sun...What now, what should I do...?</text>
<text id="10040004">...My sun, my dear, dear sun...</text>
<text id="11000000">Well, you are a rare visitor.</text>
<text id="11000001">Welcome to the lost city of Anor Londo, chosen Undead.</text>
<text id="11000002">Welcome to the lost city of Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="11000003">If you seek Lord Gwyn's old keep,</text>
<text id="11000004">exit here and head straight yonder.</text>
<text id="11000005">If you are the chosen one, a revelation shall visit thee.</text>
<text id="11000006">...What follows thereafter, depends upon you...</text>
<text id="11000100">Hmm. You have survived. Impressive.</text>
<text id="11000101">If you require rest, now is the time.</text>
<text id="11000102">That is, after all, what the bonfire is for.</text>
<text id="11000200">Hmm. So, you have received a revelation?</text>
<text id="11000201">Very auspicious. I hope for the best.</text>
<text id="11000202">I pray that through you, Her wish will be granted.</text>
<text id="11000300">Hmm. You have made it back. Very well.</text>
<text id="11000301">Hmm. You have made it back. You were gone so long.</text>
<text id="11000302">Go ahead, you may rest here.</text>
<text id="11000303">Even an Undead requires repose.</text>
<text id="11000400">Hm, what is it?</text>
<text id="11000401">What am I? Well...I am the Keeper of the bonfire.</text>
<text id="11000402">If not for me, what beacon would there be in this lost city?</text>
<text id="11000403">A gatekeeper, and a guide; that is my calling.</text>
<text id="11000500">What!</text>
<text id="11000510">How dare you!</text>
<text id="11000520">Hrk!</text>
<text id="11000530">Rrgh!</text>
<text id="11000600">Very well. So be it.</text>
<text id="11000610">Expunging fools like you is part of my charge.</text>
<text id="11000700">...But, how...</text>
<text id="11000710">...This man is a threat...</text>
<text id="11000720">...This woman is a threat...</text>
<text id="11000730">...Master Gwyndolin...</text>
<text id="11000800">Tis a pity...To think I saw potential in you...</text>
<text id="11000900">So...It was you, was it?</text>
<text id="11000901">How dare you produce a blade upon a deity? How did you ever get
this far?</text>
<text id="11000902">I shall end your suffering here and now. It is the least that I
can do.</text>
<text id="11001000">What you saw under light of the Darkmoon shall haunt you forever.</text>
<text id="11001100">Will you be departing soon,</text>
<text id="11001101">honourable heir to Gwyn's Flame...</text>
<text id="11001102">We are humbled...</text>
<text id="11001103">For we exist only with your blessing.</text>
<text id="11001200">Oh...You are one of us.</text>
<text id="11001201">That is a surprise. But a pleasant one.</text>
<text id="11001202">We are both Blades of the Darkmoon, now.</text>
<text id="11001203">I shall look forward to fighting alongside you.</text>
<text id="11001300">Have you heard of Seath the Scaleless?</text>
<text id="11001301">In legend, he turned against the ancient dragons.</text>
<text id="11001302">He became Lord Gwyn's confidant, was granted dukedom, and was
allowed to pursue his research.</text>
<text id="11001303">At the Regal Archives, he immersed himself in research on scales
of immortality, the one thing that he did not have.</text>
<text id="11001304">...But his very research drove him mad... </text>
<text id="11001305">The Archives became a dungeon, a place for sinister experiments.</text>
<text id="11001306">Now, nobody dares even approach the duke's forbidden Archives.</text>
<text id="11001307">It looms over this land, high atop the mountain.</text>
<text id="11001308">But I should warn against even an approach...</text>
<text id="11001400">The bonfires attended by the Keepers are special.</text>
<text id="11001401">They are linked to one another, and their flames never die.</text>
<text id="11001402">Yet never shall the Keepers of these flames meet.</text>
<text id="12000000">...Oh, you... You're no Hollow, eh?</text>
<text id="12000001">...Thank goodness...</text>
<text id="12000002">...I'm done for, I'm afraid...</text>
<text id="12000003">...My insides are damaged...</text>
<text id="12000004">...I'll die soon, then lose my sanity...</text>
<text id="12000005">...I can feel it coming...</text>
<text id="12000006">...I wish to ask something of you...</text>
<text id="12000007">...You are a godsend, to come at this moment...</text>
<text id="12000008">...Hah hah...</text>
<text id="12000009">...You and I, we're both Undead... Hear me out, will you?</text>
<text id="12000100">...Thank you...</text>
<text id="12000101">...Regrettably, I have failed in my mission...</text>
<text id="12000102">...But perhaps you can keep the torch lit...</text>
<text id="12000103">...There is an old saying in my family...</text>
<text id="12000104">...Thou who art Undead, art chosen...</text>
<text id="12000105">...In thine exodus from the Undead Asylum, maketh pilgrimage to
the land of Ancient Lords...</text>
<text id="12000106">...When thou ringeth the Bell of Awakening, the fate of the
Undead thou shalt know.</text>
<text id="12000107">...hng...hng...</text>
<text id="12000108">...Thank you for hearing me out...Now I can die with hope in my
heart...</text>
<text id="12000109">...Well, now you know...And I can die with hope in my heart...</text>
<text id="12000110">...hng...hng...</text>
<text id="12000111">...Oh, one more thing...Here, take this.</text>
<text id="12000112">...An Estus Flask, an Undead favourite.</text>
<text id="12000113">...It should prove useful.</text>
<text id="12000114">...Hah hah...</text>
<text id="12000115">...hng...hng...</text>
<text id="12000116">...Oh, and this...</text>
<text id="12000117">...Now I must bid farewell...</text>
<text id="12000118">...I would hate to harm you after death...So, go now...</text>
<text id="12000119">...And thank you...</text>
<text id="12000200">...Yes, I see...</text>
<text id="12000201">...Perhaps I was too hopeful...</text>
<text id="12000202">...Hah hah...</text>
<text id="12000203">...hng...hng...</text>
<text id="12000204">...Please, leave me be...</text>
<text id="12000205">...I have not long to live, and I may harm you after death.</text>
<text id="12000206">...Now, go...</text>
<text id="12000300">Hrggkt...</text>
<text id="12000301">But...why...</text>
<text id="12000400">...The key is there...</text>
<text id="12000401">...Please, come quickly...</text>
<text id="12000402">...It is your fate...</text>
<text id="12010000">A pleasure to meet you.</text>
<text id="12010001">Sage Frampt has spoken to me about you.</text>
<text id="12010002">I am Oscar of Astora.</text>
<text id="12010003">I wish to thank you for ringing the Bell of Awakening.</text>
<text id="12010004">I have received the word of Sage Frampt.</text>
<text id="12010005">I will be fine. You ought to focus on yourself.</text>
<text id="12010006">May we each fulfil our respective purposes!</text>
<text id="12010100">I am preparing to leave.</text>
<text id="12010101">I will follow Sage Frampt's instructions, and will seek Anor
Londo by way of Sen's Fortress.</text>
<text id="12010102">I hope that we meet again somewhere, one day.</text>
<text id="12010200">A pleasure to meet you.</text>
<text id="12010201">Sage Frampt has spoken to me about you.</text>
<text id="12010202">I am Oscar of Astora.</text>
<text id="12010203">I am told that you rang the Bell of Awakening, and received the
word of Frampt.</text>
<text id="12010204">That is a wonderful thing. We are all counting on you.</text>
<text id="12010205">I only wish that I had such a purpose.</text>
<text id="12010300">I am preparing to leave.</text>
<text id="12010301">I cannot just stay here. I must find my own purpose.</text>
<text id="12010302">I hope that we meet again somewhere, one day.</text>
<text id="12020000">Well, how long has it been? Glad to see you safe.</text>
<text id="12020001">You must be the same as I; in search of the grave of Sir
Artorias.</text>
<text id="12020002">But, be careful.</text>
<text id="12020003">This forest is the territory of a fierce band of thieves.</text>
<text id="12020004">They assault any and all who seek the graves.</text>
<text id="12020100">...What if we were to join forces? How about that?</text>
<text id="12020101">If we worked together, we may escape the bandits.</text>
<text id="12020102">Does that appeal to you?</text>
<text id="12020200">Very well.</text>
<text id="12020201">Let us keep our wits about us.</text>
<text id="12020202">One can always do with another pair of eyes...</text>
<text id="12020300">Yes, I see...</text>
<text id="12020301">No matter. May we meet again.</text>
<text id="12020302">I pray for your success.</text>
<text id="12020400">Things appear to have settled.</text>
<text id="12020401">I was right to partner with you. Thank you.</text>
<text id="12020402">We don't need to band together any more.</text>
<text id="12020403">I will have a short rest here.</text>
<text id="12020404">Feel free to go on ahead.</text>
<text id="12030000">...So, it was you...I had a feeling...</text>
<text id="12030001">I shall destroy you, as fate has commanded me...</text>
<text id="12030002">Foolish pawn of Darkstalker Kaathe...</text>
<text id="12030003">And fiendish Dark Lord...</text>
<text id="12030100">...I have waited for thee...</text>
<text id="12030101">...Foolish slave of the Gods, and pawn of Frampt...</text>
<text id="12030102">...I will kill you...</text>
<text id="12030103">...And become the true Dark Lord...</text>
<text id="13000000">Mm, you seem quite lucid! A rare thing in these times.</text>
<text id="13000001">I am Logan. I'm a bit cooped up, as you can see.</text>
<text id="13000002">I have a bright idea. Suppose you set me free?</text>
<text id="13000003">I'm old and empty-handed, but I could repay you with knowledge,
and sorcery.</text>
<text id="13000004">This place is melting my mind. The inactivity is repressive!</text>
<text id="13000100">Oh, heavens, thank you. I'm saved.</text>
<text id="13000101">And, I'd love to resume my travels,</text>
<text id="13000102">but I must log a few things first, and I owe you a favour. I will
return to Firelink Shrine.</text>
<text id="13000103">Speak with me there, so that I may impart my sorcery.</text>
<text id="13000200">Oh, hello. Don't mind me. Go on ahead.</text>
<text id="13000201">I'll be along later. Phoo-hah-hah, I'll be just fine, young one.</text>
<text id="13000400">I fail to see your design,</text>
<text id="13000401">but if you think I'm too old to defend myself,</text>
<text id="13000402">perhaps some sorcery will change your mind!</text>
<text id="13000500">Heavens...the folly of youth...</text>
<text id="13000501">...I'm too old for this...</text>
<text id="13010000">There you are. I was expecting you.</text>
<text id="13010001">As promised, I will share my sorceries.</text>
<text id="13010100">Hello there. You really are very diligent.</text>
<text id="13010101">I quite understand. Study is invigorating!</text>
<text id="13010200">Hello there.</text>
<text id="13010201">Very well indeed. I'm pleased to share my sorceries.</text>
<text id="13010300">Hello there. What have you been up to?</text>
<text id="13010301">I thought that perhaps you'd gone Hollow on me.</text>
<text id="13010302">So, have you come to further your study of sorcery?</text>
<text id="13010400">Hello there. I was expecting you.</text>
<text id="13010401">As promised, I will share my sorceries.</text>
<text id="13010402">...</text>
<text id="13010403">I am afraid that you are unable to learn sorcery.</text>
<text id="13010404">The basic framework, you see. It cannot be taught.</text>
<text id="13010405">Oh, do not fret. Life isn't all about sorcery. You will find your
own way.</text>
<text id="13010406">Don't frown with regret; peer forward with your head high.</text>
<text id="13010500">Hello there. Glad to see you alive.</text>
<text id="13010600">Hello there. Glad to see you alive.</text>
<text id="13010601">Hmm...</text>
<text id="13010602">It seems you've come quite a way...</text>
<text id="13010603">Excellent. You are certainly ready. I shall teach you sorceries.</text>
<text id="13010700">I will stay here for the time being.</text>
<text id="13010701">Speak to me again to further your knowledge.</text>
<text id="13010800">No results, eh...</text>
<text id="13010801">Well, the way of sorceries is a long, hard road. Take it slowly.</text>
<text id="13010900">Farewell.</text>
<text id="13011000">Heading out, are you?</text>
<text id="13011001">I, too, will leave soon. Undead or no, I shan't stay here
forever.</text>
<text id="13011002">...You have great potential. Don't go and die over nothing.</text>
<text id="13020000">Hello again! What a chance meeting this is!</text>
<text id="13020001">Alas, I'm imprisoned once again. I don't suppose you could stage
me a getaway?</text>
<text id="13020002">The Archives, such a storehouse of knowledge. So close, but just
out of reach!</text>
<text id="13020003">The thought offends me so, I could simply die!</text>
<text id="13020004">As a student of the arts, you understand me, yes?</text>
<text id="13020100">Oh, thank you very much. I'm saved.</text>
<text id="13020101">That makes twice. I must be sure to repay you.</text>
<text id="13020102">I will visit the Archives. If I discover any new spells, I shall
share them with you.</text>
<text id="13020103">Prepare to be impressed, by the onward march of sorcery!</text>
<text id="13020200">Hello. Don't mind me. Go on ahead.</text>
<text id="13020201">I'll head out soon. I wish to lay down my plans before I visit
the Archives.</text>
<text id="13020600">Hello there. I was expecting you.</text>
<text id="13020601">This place is truly magnificent, more than expected, even.</text>
<text id="13020602">As promised, I shall share the new sorceries with you.</text>
<text id="13020603">And, the secret of Seath's immortality.</text>
<text id="13020700">Hello there. You really are very diligent.</text>
<text id="13020701">Oh, I understand. We are in the midst of a revolution!</text>
<text id="13020702">Oh, hello there. Where have you been?</text>
<text id="13020703">Time is a resource. Let's delve in promptly.</text>
<text id="13020800">Oh, there you are, it has been a while.</text>
<text id="13020801">Or, were you just here?</text>
<text id="13020802">This fascinating place defeats my sense of time...</text>
<text id="13020900">Come again.</text>
<text id="13020901">The knowledge here is limitless. I will absorb it, then share it
with you.</text>
<text id="13021000">Come again, any time you please.</text>
<text id="13021001">For I too, learn, whilst teaching a student.</text>
<text id="13021100">Farewell.</text>
<text id="13021200">Mm...mm...</text>
<text id="13021201">Mm...mm...</text>
<text id="13021300">Ah, the secret of Seath's immortality?</text>
<text id="13021301">If you have fought him, and were imprisoned, you must know that
Seath is a true Undead, different from ourselves.</text>
<text id="13021302">His wounds close promptly, and no mortal blow affects him,
granting true insulation from death.</text>
<text id="13021303">It is an effect of the Primordial Crystal, a sacred treasure
pillaged by Seath when he turned upon the ancient dragons.</text>
<text id="13021304">So, only by destroying the Primordial Crystal can you so much as
scratch his hide.</text>
<text id="13021305">And it so happens, the Primordial Crystal is in the inner garden
of these very archives, the Crystal Forest.</text>
<text id="13021400">The tomes stored in these Archives are truly magnificent.</text>
<text id="13021401">A great pool of knowledge, the fruits of superior wisdom and an
unquenchable desire for the truth.</text>
<text id="13021402">Some would say Seath had an unsound fixation ...But his work is a
beautiful, invaluable resource.</text>
<text id="13021403">All progress demands sacrifice.</text>
<text id="13021404">And I certainly bear no antipathy for that wonderful scaleless
beast.</text>
<text id="13021500">...Who are you...</text>
<text id="13021501">...Stay clear...stay clear of my work...</text>
<text id="13021502">...Curses upon you!</text>
<text id="13021503">...How dare you disturb me!</text>
<text id="14000000">Somebody! Please, let me out of here!</text>
<text id="14000001">Somebody, anybody!</text>
<text id="14000002">Help me! Unlock the door!</text>
<text id="14000003">...Damn...</text>
<text id="14000004">...I'm finished...</text>
<text id="14000005">How did this ever happen...</text>
<text id="14000020">Hello! Hello!</text>
<text id="14000021">You, yes! You! I'm here, here!</text>
<text id="14000022">I'm trapped! Please! I require assistance!</text>
<text id="14000023">Try and open the door!</text>
<text id="14000040">Brilliant! You opened the door for me!</text>
<text id="14000041">Thank you; I am saved. I thought I might never escape.</text>
<text id="14000042">I am Griggs of Vinheim. A sorcerer of the school.</text>
<text id="14000043">I am much obliged for your assistance.</text>
<text id="14000044">Thanks to you, I may now resume my travels.</text>
<text id="14000100">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="14000101">I am fine. I will rest a while, then return to Firelink Shrine.</text>
<text id="14000102">I have my sorcery. And I will be more cautious next time.</text>
<text id="14000103">Besides, I have an important task at hand.</text>
<text id="14000200">Ooph!</text>
<text id="14000220">Eeg!</text>
<text id="14000240">What on Earth are you...!</text>
<text id="14000260">Cease! I implore you!</text>
<text id="14000300">Curses, you leave me no choice!</text>
<text id="14000301">You aren't yourself any more.</text>
<text id="14000302">Forgive me!</text>
<text id="14000400">Rrrg...</text>
<text id="14000401">How could this...</text>
<text id="14010000">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="14010001">I regret meeting you under such compromising circumstances.</text>
<text id="14010002">At least we both made it back unscathed.</text>
<text id="14010003">Incidentally, would you care to learn any sorceries?</text>
<text id="14010004">You're clearly talented, and besides, I owe you.</text>
<text id="14010005">Of course, we will require some materials, but I am happy to
teach you some elementary spells. Are you interested?</text>
<text id="14010020">Splendid! Very well!</text>
<text id="14010021">I am pleased to have a chance to give something back.</text>
<text id="14010022">Well, then let's get started straight away.</text>
<text id="14010040">Yes, I see...</text>
<text id="14010041">It is regrettable, but to each his own.</text>
<text id="14010042">If you change your mind, do not be bashful.</text>
<text id="14010200">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="14010201">Well, you certainly are keeping at it.</text>
<text id="14010202">Myself? I am fine. Let's get started straight away.</text>
<text id="14010220">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="14010221">What is it? Have you changed your mind?</text>
<text id="14010222">I am praying that you will. For, I owe you my life.</text>
<text id="14010300">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="14010301">Terrific to see us both in one piece.</text>
<text id="14010302">And pray that you never go Hollow! </text>
<text id="14010400">Good-bye, then.</text>
<text id="14010401">Do stay safe.</text>
<text id="14010500">All right. That'll do it.</text>
<text id="14010501">That should help you on your journey.</text>
<text id="14010502">May we meet again.</text>
<text id="14010600">Hm? What's that?</text>
<text id="14010700">No matter. Let us continue.</text>
<text id="14010800">Have you heard of Big Hat Logan?</text>
<text id="14010801">Master Logan is a great sorcerer, and my teacher.</text>
<text id="14010802">Both of us came to this land, as Undead.</text>
<text id="14010803">But one day, he departed, leaving only a note.</text>
<text id="14010804">...I suppose he wished to keep me out of harm's way.</text>
<text id="14010805">But where does that leave me?</text>
<text id="14010806">I have dedicated myself to sorcery.</text>
<text id="14010807">But Master Logan could find no use for me...</text>
<text id="14010900">Ahh, yes, the note that Master Logan left?</text>
<text id="14010901">It only said he would travel to Anor Londo, by way of Sen's
Fortress.</text>
<text id="14010902">I can only guess that he seeks the Regal Archives.</text>
<text id="14010903">For Master Logan is a tireless pursuer of wisdom.</text>
<text id="14010904">Wisdom trumps all; everything else is hogwash.</text>
<text id="14010905">When the curse turned him Undead, I am certain that he only felt
it was the perfect chance to visit this land.</text>
<text id="14010906">I only wish that I had his courage...</text>
<text id="14011000">I wish to do what I can to locate Master Logan.</text>
<text id="14011001">I am aware of my shortcomings, but I cannot very well just sit
around here and rot.</text>
<text id="14011002">Oh, do not worry. I have considered our relationship.</text>
<text id="14011003">I will only leave after I have taught you all the sorceries that
I know.</text>
<text id="14011004">I shall count myself lucky if I manage to locate Logan, or even
return here in one piece.</text>
<text id="14011200">Oh, hello again!</text>
<text id="14011201">I was waiting to tell you...Master Logan has returned!</text>
<text id="14011202">And he tells me that he has you to thank!</text>
<text id="14011203">Well, we are both in your debt, now. Thank you, sincerely.</text>
<text id="14011204">He's just over there. Go along and have a chat.</text>
<text id="14011300">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="14011301">I appreciate the attention, but you really should speak to Master
Logan.</text>
<text id="14011302">That will certainly do you more good.</text>
<text id="14011400">Have you spoken to Master Logan?</text>
<text id="14011401">He is an accomplished scholar. The arts of sorcery would never
have come this far without his contributions.</text>
<text id="14011402">And he has the nerve to go risking life and limb! What a stubborn
old fellow.</text>
<text id="14011403">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="14011500">Have you ever cast one of Logan's spells?</text>
<text id="14011501">Isn't it exhilarating?</text>
<text id="14011502">As he sees it, there are no gods, no transcendence, only truth,
and Logan only wishes to elucidate it.</text>
<text id="14011503">It is this heretical methodology that allowed Logan to advance
sorcery to the point that he has.</text>
<text id="14011504">In a word, he is a hero. Despite the awful rumours.</text>
<text id="14011505">Time will tell. The annals of history will prove dispassionate!</text>
<text id="14011600">Oh, there you are! Just so you know...</text>
<text id="14011601">Master Logan has left on his own again.</text>
<text id="14011602">It seems that he is still determined to find the famed Regal
Archives in Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="14011603">And I have decided that I must search for him.</text>
<text id="14011604">I intend to search for him. Only, before I leave, there is one
thing I wish to do.</text>
<text id="14011605">You see, Master Logan has left most of his books.</text>
<text id="14011606">With them, I could teach you Logan's sorcery.</text>
<text id="14011607">...You have done much to assist me.</text>
<text id="14011608">Before I leave on this journey, I will teach you all that Logan
has to share.</text>
<text id="14011700">Oh, hello, you made it!</text>
<text id="14011701">Then, let us begin.</text>
<text id="14011702">As promised, I shall bequeath Master Logan's sorcery to you.</text>
<text id="14011800">It's not that I am concerned for Master Logan's welfare.</text>
<text id="14011801">Even in this treacherous land, Logan's skills are unmatched. He
is a true hero.</text>
<text id="14011802">...No, the reason I seek Logan is...</text>
<text id="14011803">...Well, it's really my own conceit, now isn't it?</text>
<text id="14011900">Ohh! Master Logan is at the Archives?!</text>
<text id="14011901">Thank the heavens; finally his wish has been granted.</text>
<text id="14011902">I suppose he has his head buried in those tomes?</text>
<text id="14011903">That is always what made Master Logan happiest...</text>
<text id="14011904">Ahh, I can just imagine him now!</text>
<text id="14012000">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="14012001">Why, of course I don't mind teaching you sorceries...</text>
<text id="14012002">But now that you've located Master Logan,</text>
<text id="14012003">I can't imagine that I can be of much help.</text>
<text id="14012100">I have decided to seek the Regal Archives.</text>
<text id="14012101">I realize that I may never make it.</text>
<text id="14012102">But I would feel worthless if I did not at least try.</text>
<text id="14012103">What other choice do I have to earn Logan's recognition?</text>
<text id="14012200">Uwwah!</text>
<text id="14012220">Heavens!</text>
<text id="14012240">In the name of sanity!</text>
<text id="14012260">Cease! Have you gone mad!</text>
<text id="14012300">Damn...you've lost it, haven't you?</text>
<text id="14012301">Then I have no choice.</text>
<text id="14012302">Prepare yourself!</text>
<text id="14012400">Rrrg...</text>
<text id="14012401">Master Logan...</text>
<text id="14012500">Did you see them?</text>
<text id="14012501">The three young clerics...
headed for the Catacombs, to seek Kindling.</text>
<text id="14012502">headed for the Catacombs, to seek Kindling.</text>
<text id="14012503">Kindling is the art of feeding bonfires.</text>
<text id="14012504">The poor young girl, sent down into a tomb.</text>
<text id="14012505">What a terrible mission she is burdened with.</text>
<text id="14012600">Two things are required for sorcery.</text>
<text id="14012601">First, you must equip a wand.</text>
<text id="14012602">Second, you must attune a sorcery.</text>
<text id="14012603">Then you will be ready to fire away.</text>
<text id="14012604">Oh and don't forget to aim!</text>
<text id="15000000">So, it is thou who rescueth me?</text>
<text id="15000001">Most gracious. I am deeply obliged.</text>
<text id="15000002">I am Dusk of Oolacile.</text>
<text id="15000003">I cometh from an age long before thine...I can not stay here for
long.</text>
<text id="15000004">So, before I disappear, allow me to ask one thing.</text>
<text id="15000005">My home, Oolacile, is the home of ancient sorceries.</text>
<text id="15000006">My hope is to pass this profound knowledge to thee, with thine
approval.</text>
<text id="15000007">Would this be of assistance to thee?</text>
<text id="15000050">My heartfelt thanks. I am pleased beyond words.</text>
<text id="15000051">Then, I shalt engrave my signature.</text>
<text id="15000052">If thou art in need, pray summon me from my signature.</text>
<text id="15000053">It seems that my time is done. May the great flames guide thee.</text>
<text id="15000100">Yes, of course...I understand well.</text>
<text id="15000101">Pray forgive me. I have overstepped my boundaries.</text>
<text id="15000102">Farewell; another age, another land, beckons me to return.</text>
<text id="15000103">May the flames guide thee.</text>
<text id="15000220">What dost thou...</text>
<text id="15000240">Whatever for...</text>
<text id="15000260">Cease this barbarism...</text>
<text id="15000300">Ahh...</text>
<text id="15000301">Farewell, my rescuer...</text>
<text id="15000500">I am Dusk of Oolacile.</text>
<text id="15000501">It is an honour to see thee again.</text>
<text id="15000502">I shall follow thine wishes.</text>
<text id="15000600">If thou art in need, pray summon me again.</text>
<text id="15000601">I wish to be of assistance...</text>
<text id="15000602">May the flames guide thee.</text>
<text id="15000700">If thou art in need, pray summon me again.</text>
<text id="15000701">I only wish to be of some genuine assistance...</text>
<text id="15000702">May the flames guide thee.</text>
<text id="15000800">Wait, where... are...</text>
<text id="15000900">Thou hast return'd. Bless thee.</text>
<text id="15001100">For a very long time, I was trapped within the Crystal Golem.</text>
<text id="15001101">From my home I was taken, and banish'd to a plane of distortion.</text>
<text id="15001102">It was there, that thou came to my rescue.</text>
<text id="15001103">Long after I had relinquished all hope.</text>
<text id="15001104">So gleeful was I, my faith reneweth.</text>
<text id="15001200">The sorceries of Oolacile differ from the magic of thine age.</text>
<text id="15001201">It is difficult to explain...</text>
<text id="15001202">Oolacile sorceries are, what doth one say? They are somewhat...
of an approximation.</text>
<text id="15001203">Thine sorceries are more straight forward, negating all but thy
self.</text>
<text id="15001204">Dost thou not find some fascination in these discrepancies?</text>
<text id="15001300">My home of Oolacile was reduced to ashes, long ago, in my time.</text>
<text id="15001301">I have been alone ever since...</text>
<text id="15001302">But to be summon'd thus, and to be of service to thee...
It is... most rewarding...</text>
<text id="15001303">Oh, forgive me, such a long-past time is none of thine concern...</text>
<text id="16000000">...</text>
<text id="16000010">...</text>
<text id="16000020">...</text>
<text id="16000030">...</text>
<text id="16000040">...</text>
<text id="16000050">...</text>
<text id="16000060">...</text>
<text id="16000070">...</text>
<text id="16000080">...</text>
<text id="16000090">...</text>
<text id="16000100">...Th, thank you...</text>
<text id="16000101">...Thank...you...</text>
<text id="16000102">...I am Anastacia of Astora.</text>
<text id="16000103">...Now I can continue my duty as a Keeper.</text>
<text id="16000104">...But...</text>
<text id="16000105">...I only hope that my impure tongue does not offend.</text>
<text id="16000106">...I only wish...I could, repay you...</text>
<text id="16000107">...Please, forgive me...</text>
<text id="16000200">...Forgive me...</text>
<text id="16000201">...I am impure, my tongue never intended for restoration.</text>
<text id="16000202">...Please, if you have any heart...</text>
<text id="16000203">...Leave me be...</text>
<text id="16000204">...I wish not to speak...</text>
<text id="16000300">...Frampt has told me of you...</text>
<text id="16000301">...That you have agreed to link the Fire.</text>
<text id="16000302">...I thank you, sincerely.</text>
<text id="16000303">...Finally, the curse of the Undead will be lifted, and I can die
human.</text>
<text id="16000304">...I am powerless, but I will do all that I can.</text>
<text id="16000305">...Please, save us all...</text>
<text id="16000306">...Please...</text>
<text id="16000400">Mm...</text>
<text id="16000410">Mm...</text>
<text id="16000420">Mm...</text>
<text id="16000430">Mm...</text>
<text id="16000440">Mm...</text>
<text id="16000450">Mm...</text>
<text id="16000500">Ah...</text>
<text id="16000501">Vereor Nox</text>
<text id="17000000">You are Undead, as well?</text>
<text id="17000001">Then we've no time to fraternize. I have my mission, and you no
doubt have yours.</text>
<text id="17000002">We must not let this curse overcome us.</text>
<text id="17000100">Did I not explain the urgency of our tasks?</text>
<text id="17000101">Who are you so uncouth as to lack such judgement?</text>
<text id="17000102">By the looks of you...I should think not.</text>
<text id="17000230">Ow!</text>
<text id="17000240">Horrors!</text>
<text id="17000250">The nerve!</text>
<text id="17000300">Are you a heretic, or just plain Hollow?</text>
<text id="17000301">It matters not, for you shall not escape!</text>
<text id="17000302">You will offend the Gods no longer!</text>
<text id="17000400">Hrgkt! Eeg...</text>
<text id="17000401">Father...</text>
<text id="17000500">O piteous soul...</text>
<text id="17000501">But...perhaps...this was a fate unyielding...</text>
<text id="17000800">Hello...I will never forget what you did.</text>
<text id="17000801">I am deeply indebted,</text>
<text id="17000802">for it was not within my power to save Vince or Nico.</text>
<text id="17000803">I cannot thank you enough.</text>
<text id="17000804">In case you have not heard, I am Reah of Thorolund.</text>
<text id="17000805">I only wish there were some way I could help you,</text>
<text id="17000806">but I am inexperienced, and I only know the art of Miracles.</text>
<text id="17000807">If that could be of any help, speak to me again.</text>
<text id="17000900">Would a Miracle be of any help to you?</text>
<text id="17000901">I would be most pleased if that were so.</text>
<text id="17000902">May we discuss Miracles, then?</text>
<text id="17001000">I am most pleased to find you in good health.</text>
<text id="17001001">I am ready. Let us speak of Miracles.</text>
<text id="17001100">I was wondering when you might return.</text>
<text id="17001101">It is a great relief to see you. Now, let us speak of Miracles.</text>
<text id="17001200">Oh! Please, forgive me. I was absorbed in prayer.</text>
<text id="17001201">The Miracles, I presume? I will be ready immediately.</text>
<text id="17001300">Then, be safe.</text>
<text id="17001301">Farewell.</text>
<text id="17001302">Vereor Nox</text>
<text id="17001400">Vince and Nico were fooled by a lout named Patches, and turned
into Hollows.</text>
<text id="17001401">My prayers did them no good.</text>
<text id="17001402">It is my ignorance, my frailty that has sealed their fates.</text>
<text id="17001403">Perhaps Petrus realized my weakness all along,</text>
<text id="17001404">and thus made the decision to abandon me.</text>
<text id="17001405">I can hardly blame him now.</text>
<text id="17001500">I do not warm easily to unfamiliar faces.</text>
<text id="17001501">The bonfire below is so very frequented, it makes it difficult...</text>
<text id="17001502">I have lost all those who were close to me.</text>
<text id="17001700">Why on earth would you...</text>
<text id="17001701">Perhaps this is my punishment?</text>
<text id="17001702">Clearly, I am no threat to you. But please, I ask just one thing.</text>
<text id="17001703">If I do go Hollow, then finish me off.</text>
<text id="17001704">I beg of you.</text>
<text id="17001800">Dear Vince, dear Nico...</text>
<text id="17001801">Forgive me...</text>
<text id="17010000">You're no Hollow, are you?</text>
<text id="17010001">Thank goodness.</text>
<text id="17010002">Please be careful. There are two fierce Hollows not far from
here.</text>
<text id="17010003">They were once brave knights...my former escorts.</text>
<text id="17010004">Who would let such strong spirits be Hollowed so?</text>
<text id="17010005">Heavens...Is there nothing...Nothing at all to be done?</text>
<text id="17010100">You banished those two Hollows, did you?</text>
<text id="17010101">It pains me to think of the trouble my failings have caused.</text>
<text id="17010102">I am certain that both Vince and Nico are grateful to you.</text>
<text id="17010103">Thank you so very much.</text>
<text id="17010104">Here, these belonged to them. You deserve them more than I.</text>
<text id="18000000">Hello there. I believe we are not acquainted?</text>
<text id="18000001">I am Petrus of Thorolund. Have you business with us?</text>
<text id="18000002">...If not, I'd prefer to keep a distance, if possible.</text>
<text id="18000003">We are on a mission, as you likely are too. A very important one
at that.</text>
<text id="18000004">Especially for M'lady. Surely you can understand?</text>
<text id="18000100">Hello there.</text>
<text id="18000101">I realize that I have requested that we retain our distance,</text>
<text id="18000102">But I also want you to know that it is not meant in ill-will.</text>
<text id="18000103">Here, take this. As a token of peace.</text>
<text id="18000104">No, go ahead. It's for you.</text>
<text id="18000200">Oh, my... you again?</text>
<text id="18000201">Empathy, in excess, becomes a sin.</text>
<text id="18000202">But you already knew that...I should hope?</text>
<text id="18000300">Oh, you yet again?</text>
<text id="18000301">We shall depart on our mission soon,</text>
<text id="18000302">for M'lady has made her final decision.</text>
<text id="18000303">So, I must say farewell, although with great regret.</text>
<text id="18000304">Vereor Nox</text>
<text id="18000400">Hrg!</text>
<text id="18000410">Ooh!</text>
<text id="18000420">Mrgm!</text>
<text id="18000430">Ooph!</text>
<text id="18000500">By the Lords! You damn fool!</text>
<text id="18000501">Enough of you! Feel the wrath of the gods!</text>
<text id="18000600">N...no...this can't be...</text>
<text id="18000601">It can't end like this...</text>
<text id="18010000">Uh, oh, you again?</text>
<text id="18010001">Me? Er, I've become separated from M'lady.</text>
<text id="18010002">I've scoured near and far, but no sight of her...</text>
<text id="18010003">Where could she have gone?</text>
<text id="18010004">M'lady...To think I swore to protect you with my life...</text>
<text id="18010100">Your Highness...where have you gone?</text>
<text id="18010101">I am entirely to blame for this...</text>
<text id="18010102">Oh woe is me. I am unworthy, deathly so...</text>
<text id="18010200">Oh, hello there.</text>
<text id="18010201">Have you spoken with Sir Lautrec?</text>
<text id="18010202">Splendid. In the depths of the Catacombs, M'lady slipped off the
giant's coffin and into a hole.</text>
<text id="18010203">Her two companions are no longer human; and the lass weeps in
solitude.</text>
<text id="18010204">Right now, you could do as you please with her. The poor little
purebred is entirely helpless.</text>
<text id="18010205">Keh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="18010300">In the depths of the Catacombs, M'lady slipped off the giant's
coffin and into a hole.</text>
<text id="18010301">Her two companions are no longer human; and the lady weeps in
solitude.</text>
<text id="18010302">Keh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="18010400">...Ah, oh, you. Have you seen M'lady?</text>
<text id="18010401">Oh, blast, where might she be, and would she be safe...</text>
<text id="18010500">Are, are you sure?! Then M'lady...</text>
<text id="18010501">What terrifying news! What am I to do...</text>
<text id="18010502">All because of my shortcomings...it is my fault...</text>
<text id="18010503">Sob...</text>
<text id="18010600">...Oh, it's you...</text>
<text id="18010601">...You rescued M'lady?</text>
<text id="18010602">Well, a pity that is, for it will amount to nothing.</text>
<text id="18010603">For the little madam is not worth her salt without her family
name.</text>
<text id="18010604">Keh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="18010700">Hrgkt!</text>
<text id="18010710">Ooph!</text>
<text id="18010720">Mnph!</text>
<text id="18010730">Argh!</text>
<text id="18010800">What is it, fool? Driven to madness by emotion?</text>
<text id="18010801">So be it. You'll make a fine Hollow!</text>
<text id="18010802">You can waltz in the infernal depths together!</text>
<text id="18010900">Rrk! Why...how could I...</text>
<text id="18010901">What the...what did I do wrong...</text>
<text id="18011000">Fool...What were you thinking?</text>
<text id="18011001">Too bad for you, I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing. Best of luck as
a Hollow!</text>
<text id="18011002">Gah hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="18011100">Oh, hello...</text>
<text id="18011101">Of course I will repay you. I gave you my word.</text>
<text id="18011102">I'm just not sure what would do...</text>
<text id="18011103">Oh, I know. How about this...</text>
<text id="18011104">I have to await my companions here anyway,</text>
<text id="18011105">so, what if I were to teach you some miracles?</text>
<text id="18011106">Would that please you?</text>
<text id="18011200">Very well. Then first, a Covenant with the Gods.</text>
<text id="18011201">Now, let me share my Miracles.</text>
<text id="18011202">Only, their ultimate effectiveness will be determined by your
efforts, and your faith.</text>
<text id="18011300">That is a shame. But each to their own.</text>
<text id="18011301">Speak to me if you have a change of heart.</text>
<text id="18011400">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="18011401">I will teach you Miracles. A promise is a promise, after all.</text>
<text id="18011500">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="18011501">Miracles, I presume? Yes, I know.</text>
<text id="18011600">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="18011601">What is it? Have you changed your mind?</text>
<text id="18011700">Come again.</text>
<text id="18011701">The effectiveness of the teachings depend upon your faith.</text>
<text id="18011702">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="18011800">My guests have finally arrived.</text>
<text id="18011801">I will be departing with them shortly.</text>
<text id="18011802">So, I'm afraid I will be saying good-bye soon.</text>
<text id="18011803">It was a pleasure.</text>
<text id="18011900">My companions are M'lady and her young knights.</text>
<text id="18011901">She is young, but burdened by an Undead mission.</text>
<text id="18011902">We are her defences, to keep her from harm.</text>
<text id="18012000">An Undead mission?</text>
<text id="18012001">Regrettably, I cannot share that with you.</text>
<text id="18012002">But you are my pupil, perhaps if you show your faith...</text>
<text id="18012100">Very well. I can surely tell you, of all people...</text>
<text id="18012101">Undead clerics are given a mission to seek Kindling.</text>
<text id="18012102">Kindling is the art of feeding bonfires with humanity.</text>
<text id="18012103">Through Kindling, we shall one day be granted magnificent powers.</text>
<text id="18012200">I am afraid that may be difficult. For our missions are sacred.</text>
<text id="18012300">Reah is the youngest daughter of the good house of Thorolund.</text>
<text id="18012301">Those young knights are her old schoolmates,</text>
<text id="18012302">But I'm not sure what to make of them...</text>
<text id="18012303">I'm afraid they may be a bad influence...</text>
<text id="18012400">Oh, I'm sorry. Miracles, was it?</text>
<text id="18012420">...Sometimes I lose myself; pay me no mind!</text>
<text id="18012460">...I'm distracted by grief; pay me no mind!</text>
<text id="18020000">Help me!</text>
<text id="18020001">Somebody! Help me!</text>
<text id="18020002">I am trapped!</text>
<text id="18020100">You there, please, help me...</text>
<text id="18020101">As you can see I am captured, immobilized.</text>
<text id="18020102">Soon to be a sacrifice to necromancy.</text>
<text id="18020103">I implore you...please help...</text>
<text id="18020104">Ooh...</text>
<text id="18020200">Phew...I am saved.</text>
<text id="18020201">Thank you. I owe you my life.</text>
<text id="18020202">I am Petrus of Thorolund.</text>
<text id="18020203">I will be sure to repay you, back at Firelink Shrine.</text>
<text id="18020204">Please, no, it's the least that I can do.</text>
<text id="18020300">Please, rest assured.</text>
<text id="18020301">I shall repay you, but back at Firelink Shrine.</text>
<text id="18020302">The Gods do not look favourably upon haste!</text>
<text id="19000000">Hm? What have we here?</text>
<text id="19000001">You look awfully raggedy; are you all right?</text>
<text id="19000002">You look awfully raggedy...</text>
<text id="19000003">Times are grim; the least you can do is look sharp.</text>
<text id="19000004">Don't you dare meet M'lady like that.</text>
<text id="19000005">You might scare her off for good!</text>
<text id="19000100">Oh, you again. What business have you?</text>
<text id="19000101">I don't suppose we can help, though.</text>
<text id="19000102">We accompany M'lady on her righteous mission.</text>
<text id="19000103">It is quite a chore, but I'm stuck with her, and Nico, too.</text>
<text id="19000104">I can't very well abandon them now.</text>
<text id="19000200">Oh, you yet again. You're a persistent one, aren't you? Hah hah
hah.</text>
<text id="19000201">Honestly, I don't have a problem with your kind.</text>
<text id="19000202">But there's not very much that I can do.</text>
<text id="19000203">I am Vince of Thorolund.</text>
<text id="19000204">Let's say a word, for our safety.</text>
<text id="19000205">A prayer to our marvellous Lord.</text>
<text id="19000206">Vereor Nox</text>
<text id="19000300">Oh, it's you?</text>
<text id="19000301">We are to leave momentarily.</text>
<text id="19000302">The Catacombs aren't exactly my idea of a good time, but...</text>
<text id="19000303">What can one do? I do hope we meet again.</text>
<text id="19000304">Vereor Nox</text>
<text id="19000420">Egads!</text>
<text id="19000430">What the!</text>
<text id="19000500">Curses! What the devil's wrong with you?</text>
<text id="19000501">I cannot overlook a threat to M'lady!</text>
<text id="19000502">I'll grind you into dust!</text>
<text id="19000600">By the Gods...</text>
<text id="19000601">...My...dear lady...</text>
<text id="20000000">Mnnn...</text>
<text id="20000100">Mnnn...</text>
<text id="20000200">Mnnn...</text>
<text id="20000300">Mnnn...</text>
<text id="20000400">Mnnn...</text>
<text id="20000500">Mnnn...</text>
<text id="20000600">Mnnn...</text>
<text id="20000700">Mnnn...</text>
<text id="20000800">Mnnn...</text>
<text id="20000900">Mnnn...</text>
<text id="21000000">Thou hast journey'd far, and overcome much, chosen Undead.</text>
<text id="21000001">I hath long await'd thee.</text>
<text id="21000002">Come hither, child...</text>
<text id="21000100">O chosen Undead.</text>
<text id="21000101">I am Gwynevere.</text>
<text id="21000102">Daughter of Lord Gwyn; and Queen of Sunlight.</text>
<text id="21000103">Since the day Father his form did obscureth, I have await'd thee.</text>
<text id="21000104">Once living, now Undead, and a fitting heir to father Gwyn thou
art,</text>
<text id="21000105">O chosen Undead.</text>
<text id="21000106">I bequeath the Lordvessel to thee.</text>
<text id="21000107">And beseech thee. Succeed Lord Gwyn, and inheriteth the Fire of
our world.</text>
<text id="21000108">A grave and arduous test of mettle, yea, it shall be.</text>
<text id="21000109">Indeed we had felt the warmth of Fire, its radiance, and the life
it sustaineth.</text>
<text id="21000110">Without Fire, all shall be a frigid and frightful Dark.</text>
<text id="21000111">Yet I have only thee to ask.</text>
<text id="21000112">Please. Father's role thou should assume, and inheriteth the Fire
of our world.</text>
<text id="21000113">Thou shall endeth this eternal twilight, and avert further Undead
sacrifices.</text>
<text id="21000114">Kingseeker Frampt, the primordial serpent, shall guideth thee.</text>
<text id="21000115">Furthermore, chosen Undead.</text>
<text id="21000116">Hereafter, I, Gwynevere, shall serveth as thine guardian.</text>
<text id="21000117">If thou so needest, I shalt devote all to thine safety.</text>
<text id="21000118">May thou be one with the sunlight for evermore.</text>
<text id="21000200">O Chosen Undead.</text>
<text id="21000201">Thou hath journey'd far.</text>
<text id="21000202">Mineself art thine guardian. I offer all in thine assistance.</text>
<text id="21000300">Now thou shalt go forth, chosen Undead.</text>
<text id="21000301">May thou be one with the sunlight for evermore.</text>
<text id="21000500">Aieegh...</text>
<text id="21000600">Magnificent...Thou hast filled the Lordvessel.</text>
<text id="21000601">Indeed, a worthy successor, thou shalt be.</text>
<text id="21000602">My patience was not for nil...</text>
<text id="21000603">I beg of thee. Succeed Lord Gwyn, and inheriteth the world's
Fire.</text>
<text id="21000604">We have only thee.</text>
<text id="22000000">Thou that tarnisheth the Godmother's image.</text>
<text id="22000001">I am Gwyndolin.</text>
<text id="22000002">And thy transgression shall not go unpunished.</text>
<text id="22000003">Thou shalt perish in the twilight of Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="22000100">Heretic...</text>
<text id="22000101">First thou offendeth the Godmother, and now thou see fit to
trample upon the tomb of the Great Lord.</text>
<text id="22000102">I am the Dark Sun, Gwyndolin!</text>
<text id="22000103">Let the atonement for thy felonies commenceth!</text>
<text id="22000200">O Heretic, swathed in Dark...</text>
<text id="22000201">An eternal curse upon thee...</text>
<text id="22000300">Halt!</text>
<text id="22000301">This is the tomb of the Great Lord Gwyn.</text>
<text id="22000302">Tarnished, it shall not be, by the feet of men.</text>
<text id="22000303">If thou art a true disciple of the Dark Sun, cast aside thine
ire, </text>
<text id="22000304">hear the voice of mineself, Gwyndolin, and kneel before me.</text>
<text id="22000500">Welcome back, Blade of the Darkmoon.</text>
<text id="22000501">If mine power be need'st, I shall assist thee.</text>
<text id="22000600">Very well, Blade of the Darkmoon.</text>
<text id="22000601">Please state thy wish.</text>
<text id="22000800">What foolishness...</text>
<text id="22000801">Why trespasseth upon the Great Lord's tomb, whilst thou art a
disciple of the Dark Sun?</text>
<text id="22000802">Why would a Blade of the Darkmoon trespasseth upon the Great
Lord's tomb?</text>
<text id="22000803">Mark the words of mineself, Gwyndolin!</text>
<text id="22000804">Thou shalt not go unpunished!</text>
<text id="22000900">O Disciple of the Dark Sun.</text>
<text id="22000901">Thou hast journeyed far; hear my voice.</text>
<text id="22000902">If thou shalt swear by the Covenant, to become</text>
<text id="22000903">A shadow of Father Gwyn and Sister Gwynevere,</text>
<text id="22000904">A blade that shall hunt the foes of our Lords;</text>
<text id="22000905">Then I shalt protect thee, safeguarding thy person with the power
of the Darkmoon.</text>
<text id="22001000">Very well. Now thou art a Blade of the Darkmoon.</text>
<text id="22001001">Hunteth the enemies of the Lords, by the power of the Dark Sun.</text>
<text id="22001100">Very well.</text>
<text id="22001101">We shall not need speech.</text>
<text id="22001102">Exit here, and follow thine own design.</text>
<text id="23000000">...Hrr...rrgg...</text>
<text id="23000001">...somebody...</text>
<text id="23000002">...please...help me...</text>
<text id="23000003">...please...</text>

<text id="23000046">...Oh, please...</text>
<text id="23000100">...Th-thank you.</text>
<text id="23000101">I would have been her supper without you.</text>
<text id="23000102">Being eaten alive! I shudder to think...</text>
<text id="23000103">Thank you, thank you dearly.</text>
<text id="23000104">I am Laurentius, of the Great Swamp.</text>
<text id="23000105">I will not forget my debt to you.</text>
<text id="23000200">Oh, hello there.</text>
<text id="23000201">I'm fine, thanks to you.</text>
<text id="23000202">I'm heading back to the Undead Asylum.</text>
<text id="23000300">Whoa!</text>
<text id="23000320">What are you doing?!</text>
<text id="23000340">It is I, Laurentius!</text>
<text id="23000360">I have no bone to pick with you!</text>
<text id="23000400">Curse the heavens! Are you mad!</text>
<text id="23000401">I owe my life to you!</text>
<text id="23000402">This is wrong! You were my friend!</text>
<text id="23000500">Curses...</text>
<text id="23010000">Well, I see you made it out!</text>
<text id="23010001">Yeah, I made it out safely, too.</text>
<text id="23010002">I have my Pyromancy of the Great Swamp, so I can usually manage,
with a bit of care.</text>
<text id="23010003">Oh, yeah, by the way, er, I can share my spells with you.</text>
<text id="23010004">I think you have a knack for it. All you need are the materials.</text>
<text id="23010005">I'd be pleased to help you.</text>
<text id="23010006">...Ah, unless you find the magics unsavoury?</text>
<text id="23010020">Yeah, wonderful!</text>
<text id="23010021">I'm sure they'll be of some use, some assistance.</text>
<text id="23010022">Here, first, take this.</text>
<text id="23010023">A flame from the Great Swamp. Now you're a fully-fledged
pyromancer.</text>
<text id="23010024">Why, let's get started right now.</text>
<text id="23010040">Oh, really...Well, that's a shame.</text>
<text id="23010041">But it is your choice.</text>
<text id="23010042">I'm on the fringe; yeah, I know. Undead or not, that's who I am.</text>
<text id="23010043">I only wish that I could have repaid you somehow.</text>
<text id="23010100">Oh, hello, there.</text>
<text id="23010101">I am pleased to see you safe.</text>
<text id="23010102">As always, if you provide the materials, I can teach you
pyromancy.</text>
<text id="23010120">Oh, hello, there.</text>
<text id="23010121">I am pleased to see you safe.</text>
<text id="23010122">Oh, and er...if by chance you've had a change of heart,</text>
<text id="23010123">I'll be pleased to assist you by sharing my spells.</text>
<text id="23010250">Oh, hello there.</text>
<text id="23010251">I'm pleased to see you safe.</text>
<text id="23010252">I have decided to rest here for a while.</text>
<text id="23010253">It's not as if we'll be dying anytime soon.</text>
<text id="23010300">Good-bye, then.</text>
<text id="23010301">Be safe, friend.</text>
<text id="23010302">Don't you dare go Hollow.</text>
<text id="23010400">Good-bye, then.</text>
<text id="23010401">Come back if you find anything new.</text>
<text id="23010500">Wait, friend!</text>
<text id="23010501">Where are you off to?</text>
<text id="23010600">That was rather abrupt.</text>
<text id="23010601">You are an odd one.</text>
<text id="23010602">Hah hah hah hah.</text>
<text id="23010700">Whoa!</text>
<text id="23010720">What's wrong with you!</text>
<text id="23010740">Stop that, please!</text>
<text id="23010800">You detest my pyromancy! That must be it!</text>
<text id="23010801">Then, I'll give you a taste of it!</text>
<text id="23010802">And it will not be pleasant, I assure you!</text>
<text id="23010900">Aaahhhh...</text>
<text id="23011000">Pyromancy is the art of casting fire.</text>
<text id="23011001">Produce flame, then channel it; just as our ancestors did.</text>
<text id="23011002">A pyromancer must be in tune with nature herself.</text>
<text id="23011003">My home, the Great Swamp, is an abundant store of nature.</text>
<text id="23011004">You will understand, one day; it only takes time.</text>
<text id="23011100">Pyromancy has a, well, rather primitive aspect to it.</text>
<text id="23011101">It meshes poorly with advanced culture,</text>
<text id="23011102">and pyromancers are considered rather unsavoury.</text>
<text id="23011103">Which is fine, as I never got along with anybody anyway.</text>
<text id="23011104">So, for me, turning Undead didn't change a thing!</text>
<text id="23011105">Hah hah hah hah.</text>
<text id="23011200">My teacher, whom I imagine still resides in the Great Swamp,</text>
<text id="23011201">had a funny way of putting it.</text>
<text id="23011202">He said that "Pyromancy is the ultimate fantasy....</text>
<text id="23011203">"We are born into Dark, and warmed by Fire, but this Fire we
cannot touch."</text>
<text id="23011204">"Those whose fascination with Fire persists, learn to hold it in
their own hand."</text>
<text id="23011205">He rather had a way with words, the old withering frog!</text>
<text id="23011300">In this land, pyromancers earn a certain respect.</text>
<text id="23011301">The Witch of Izalith, one of the legendary Lords,</text>
<text id="23011302">is the godmother of pyromancy.</text>
<text id="23011303">So, the day I became Undead, I was ecstatic.</text>
<text id="23011304">I felt as if I'd been chosen to attune myself to the ancient
arts.</text>
<text id="23011305">...Of course, it wasn't all that romantic in the end...</text>
<text id="23011400">Ah, hello, there.</text>
<text id="23011401">You've been a stranger these days.</text>
<text id="23011402">Why, what spectacular pyromancy.</text>
<text id="23011403">Tell me about it. I have never seen anything like it.</text>
<text id="23011500">Why, yes, of course!</text>
<text id="23011501">Thank you for sharing.</text>
<text id="23011502">I'm still an able pyromancer. I shall locate her myself.</text>
<text id="23011503">I am in your debt, once again.</text>
<text id="23011600">...I see. I suppose I was mistaken.</text>
<text id="23011601">In any case, I definitely trust you.</text>
<text id="23011602">Apologies, my friend.</text>
<text id="23011603">Forget that I said anything.</text>
<text id="23011700">A pyromancer's flame is a part of his own body.</text>
<text id="23011701">The flame develops right along with his skill.</text>
<text id="23011720">...Sorry. You're a pyromancer yourself. You already know this.</text>
<text id="23011740">When I gave you that flame, I gave you a part of myself.</text>
<text id="23011741">Please take good care of it.</text>
<text id="24000000">Go back.</text>
<text id="24000001">Forbidden be, these parts. The realm of the creatures of chaos.</text>
<text id="24000002">They accept their banished fate.</text>
<text id="24000003">Go back.</text>
<text id="24000004">Lest the flames devour all,</text>
<text id="24000005">and the children of chaos feed upon your charred ashes.</text>
<text id="24000100">Those who defy the pact...</text>
<text id="24000101">Those who trespass Quelaag's domain...</text>
<text id="24000102">May you feel the depth of our wrath!</text>
<text id="24000200">Ahh, a precious new sacrifice!</text>
<text id="24000201">Forbidden be, these parts. The realm of the creatures of chaos.</text>
<text id="24000202">Go on, go on ahead...</text>
<text id="24000300">Welcome, bringer of meat.</text>
<text id="24000301">The children of chaos are hungry; give yourself to Quelaag's
flame!</text>
<text id="25000000">Quelaag?</text>
<text id="25000001">My dear sister.</text>
<text id="25000002">Don't worry for me. I care only to assist you.</text>
<text id="25000100">Quelaag, what is it?</text>
<text id="25000101">There must be something I can do?</text>
<text id="25000150">Oh, my dear sister.</text>
<text id="25000151">Don't mind me. It does not hurt terribly.</text>
<text id="25000152">Your visits help more than anything.</text>
<text id="25000300">Good-bye, Quelaag.</text>
<text id="25000301">It was so very nice to chat.</text>
<text id="25000400">Good-bye, Quelaag.</text>
<text id="25000401">Do be safe.</text>
<text id="25000500">Why, Quelaag!</text>
<text id="25000501">Where...</text>
<text id="25000600">Quelaag, what was that?</text>
<text id="25000601">Is something troubling you?</text>
<text id="25000700">Enter a Covenant? Again?</text>
<text id="25000701">Of course. Let me try...</text>
<text id="25001000">Ah...</text>
<text id="25001020">Ahh!</text>
<text id="25001040">Eek!</text>
<text id="25001200">Quelaag...</text>
<text id="25001201">But, why...?</text>
<text id="25001300">Quelaag, my dear sister...</text>
<text id="25001301">The eggs...it hurts. They've gone still...</text>
<text id="25001302">I am afraid...it may be too late...</text>
<text id="25001303">...I am so sorry, dear sister...</text>
<text id="25001400">Quelaag, my dear sister...</text>
<text id="25001401">You know, I still remember...</text>
<text id="25001402">Your beautiful, silky face...</text>
<text id="25001403">If only I could gaze upon it once more...</text>
<text id="25001500">I'll be fine, I have you, dear sister.</text>
<text id="25001501">But promise me...</text>
<text id="25001502">That you will take care of yourself.</text>
<text id="25001600">Quelaag?</text>
<text id="25001601">Please, sister, do not cry.</text>
<text id="25001602">I am happy, really. I have you, don't I?</text>
<text id="25001700">...Ooh!</text>
<text id="25001701">Thank you, Quelaag.</text>
<text id="25001702">It feels...wonderful.</text>
<text id="25001703">It really helps, it does...</text>
<text id="25001800">Ahh...</text>
<text id="25001801">Thank you...Dear sister...</text>
<text id="25001802">...It hurts no longer...</text>
<text id="25001900">...?</text>
<text id="26000000">...Oh dear...What have we here? Are you a new servant?</text>
<text id="26000020">...Hmph. But you have no eggs?</text>
<text id="26000021">Bah, no matter. Go along and have audience with Our Fair Lady.</text>
<text id="26000022">I pray that you will mind your manners!</text>
<text id="26000040">Then you shall not pass. Away with you!</text>
<text id="26000100">What is it? Go along, and meet Our Fair Lady.</text>
<text id="26000200">The nerve of you! Be gone, be gone at once!</text>
<text id="26000300">...You, you speak the tongue of the Fair Lady?</text>
<text id="26000301">...</text>
<text id="26000302">Well, do not be rash with your pride. You have yet to earn my
trust.</text>
<text id="26000303">If you try anything funny with the Fair Lady, there will be hell
to pay.</text>
<text id="26000400">Are you prepared to dedicate yourself to Our Fair Lady?</text>
<text id="26000401">Then I will make available whatever you require.</text>
<text id="26000402">If you need something, ask me first.</text>
<text id="26000500">You again...</text>
<text id="26000600">Are you in need already?</text>
<text id="26000601">Well, anything for the Fair Lady...What do you want?</text>
<text id="26000700">There is no time for idle chat.</text>
<text id="26000701">Think only of Our Fair Lady, and what she may need.</text>
<text id="26000800">...There is nothing to say to you...</text>
<text id="26000801">Except...If you lay a hand on the Fair Lady,</text>
<text id="26000802">you should be prepared to face my wrath.</text>
<text id="26000900">Well!</text>
<text id="26000901">...Now...you're just like me...</text>
<text id="26000902">Your dedication is fully apparent. Only, well...Your head looks
awful...</text>
<text id="26000903">Why not try this? I've no use for it any longer.</text>
<text id="26001000">Well!</text>
<text id="26001001">That head of yours...Nothing seems to help, does it?</text>
<text id="26001002">I still have medicine. Go ahead and use it.</text>
<text id="26001003">Now, now, no need to fret about it.</text>
<text id="26001004">Things will be fine, one day...</text>
<text id="26001100">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="26001101">What is it that you need?</text>
<text id="26001200">Oh, hello...A pleasure to see you again.</text>
<text id="26001201">But don't neglect the Fair Lady. She needs some company.</text>
<text id="26001300">In all honesty, I am envious.</text>
<text id="26001301">What comfort can I offer, without speaking her tongue?</text>
<text id="26001400">Worse than Undead, we are diseased, and unwanted.</text>
<text id="26001401">Like the grime of the Great Swamp.</text>
<text id="26001402">But my dear, Fair Lady! She cried for me...</text>
<text id="26001403">And swallowed the great Blightpus, despite Mistress Quelaag's
orders to the contrary.</text>
<text id="26001500">Hrgkt!</text>
<text id="26001510">Erggkt!</text>
<text id="26001520">Oog!</text>
<text id="26001530">Hagkt!</text>
<text id="26001600">I knew it! I knew it!</text>
<text id="26001601">You will not get away with this!</text>
<text id="26001650">You...you would betray us?!</text>
<text id="26001651">I should have known!</text>
<text id="26001700">Hrg...rgggkt...</text>
<text id="26001701">My dear Fair Lady...You are in danger...</text>
<text id="26001800">Why, youuuuu monster...!</text>
<text id="26001801">The Fair Lady! What have you done, what have you done!</text>
<text id="26001802">Hrggreeeeeeeeeeh!</text>
<text id="26001900">Below us lies the ruins of the legendary city of Izalith.</text>
<text id="26001901">There, the Molten Giant watches over the Flame of Chaos.</text>
<text id="26001902">Our Fair Lady, and Mistress Quelaag, fled from the ruins.</text>
<text id="26001903">I do not know the details...And I do not ask...</text>
<text id="26002000">Have you heard of Lost Quelana?</text>
<text id="26002001">An inhuman witch, who wanders the Poison Swamp.</text>
<text id="26002002">Only no one has ever seen her, so who really knows?</text>
<text id="26002003">But what if she is another of the Quelaag sisters?</text>
<text id="26002004">Our Fair Lady would be greatly comforted by her presence.</text>
<text id="26002100">Incidentally, do you have an interest in pyromancy?</text>
<text id="26002101">Have you developed an interest in pyromancy?</text>
<text id="26002102">If you have, I shall share my flame with you.</text>
<text id="26002200">You have served our Fair Lady well.</text>
<text id="26002201">Now, let this strength be yours.</text>
<text id="26002300">...Well, fine. I will not force you.</text>
<text id="27000000">Hmm...A mere Undead, yet you can see me? Fascinating...</text>
<text id="27000001">I am Quelana of Izalith.</text>
<text id="27000002">I am not often revealed to walkers of flesh. You have a gift.</text>
<text id="27000003">Are you, too, one who seeks my pyromancy?</text>
<text id="27000004">Like Salaman.</text>
<text id="27000020">Yes, of course. It should be expected.</text>
<text id="27000021">Very well. You shall be my pupil.</text>
<text id="27000022">But to pursue my pyromancy, you must give something up.</text>
<text id="27000023">Are you prepared to do this?</text>
<text id="27000040">Hmm, very well. Then we are done.</text>
<text id="27000041">You have spoken. Now away with you.</text>
<text id="27000060">What? Considering my pyromancy?</text>
<text id="27000100">Ah, there you are.</text>
<text id="27000101">I was expecting you. Let us begin.</text>
<text id="27000120">Ah, you again.</text>
<text id="27000121">I applaud your diligence, but what have you brought for me?</text>
<text id="27000122">I applaud your diligence.</text>
<text id="27000140">Ah. It has been some time.</text>
<text id="27000141">Truth be told, I thought you had perished.</text>
<text id="27000200">No luck, hmm...</text>
<text id="27000201">Well, young pupil, you must have patience.</text>
<text id="27000202">Do not let it bother you.</text>
<text id="27000203">But do not keep me waiting much longer.</text>
<text id="27000300">Now, go.</text>
<text id="27000301">Yes, now go.</text>
<text id="27000302">Whatever you do, do not crack and go Hollow.</text>
<text id="27000303">Don't you dare let yourself go Hollow.</text>
<text id="27000304">Lest my time spent on you be wasted.</text>
<text id="27000320">Ah, very well.</text>
<text id="27000321">There is nothing left for me to teach you.</text>
<text id="27000322">Our time together is done. It was short, but sweet.</text>
<text id="27000340">Fool. Hurry along.</text>
<text id="27000342">I can do nothing more for you.</text>
<text id="27000400">Hm? What's the rush?</text>
<text id="27000500">What was that? You are a peculiar one.</text>
<text id="27000640">What is it! Fool!</text>
<text id="27000660">Stop that!</text>
<text id="27000700">Hmm...The voice of reason fails?</text>
<text id="27000701">Then here is a lesson for you...</text>
<text id="27000702">That you can only learn once!</text>
<text id="27000800">Farewell, my mother, my sisters...</text>
<text id="27000801">What have you done...</text>
<text id="27000900">Long ago, I accepted another pupil, like yourself.</text>
<text id="27000901">Over two-hundred years ago, there was a man, almost as bungling
as you...</text>
<text id="27000902">In your world he was called Salaman the Master Pyromancer.</text>
<text id="27000903">The little rascal really made something of himself.</text>
<text id="27001000">Pyromancy is the art of invoking and manipulating fire.</text>
<text id="27001001">But remember one thing.</text>
<text id="27001002">Always fear the flame, lest you be devoured by it, and lose
yourself.</text>
<text id="27001003">I would hate to see that happen again...</text>
<text id="27001100">The Witch of Izalith?</text>
<text id="27001101">...Please, do not speak of her.</text>
<text id="27001102">...I abandoned my mother and sisters and fled to this land.</text>
<text id="27001103">...Now I roam these parts, feigning ablution,</text>
<text id="27001104">and pretending to seek answers.</text>
<text id="27001200">...Hmm...</text>
<text id="27001201">I have a favour to ask...</text>
<text id="27001202">My mother, the Witch of Izalith, was one of the primeval Lords...</text>
<text id="27001203">Her power came from the soul that she found near the First Flame.</text>
<text id="27001204">...She focused this power to light a flame of her own, but she
failed to control it.</text>
<text id="27001205">The Flame of Chaos engulfed Mother and my sisters, and moulded
them into deformed creatures.</text>
<text id="27001206">Only I escaped, and now I am here.</text>
<text id="27001207">But my mother and sisters have been in anguish since.</text>
<text id="27001208">I beseech you. Free Mother and my sisters from the Flame of
Chaos.</text>
<text id="27001209">I cannot do it myself; I lack the strength, and the bravery...</text>
<text id="27001210">...But you...</text>
<text id="27001211">I realize what I am asking. But please, free their poor souls...</text>
<text id="27001212">Mother's ambitions were misguided, no doubt, but surely a
thousand years of atonement is enough!</text>
<text id="27001300">Outstanding...You have done very well.</text>
<text id="27001301">Thank you. I am blessed to have met you.</text>
<text id="27001302">I suppose I can call you fool no longer...</text>
<text id="27001400">I can hardly thank you enough.</text>
<text id="27001401">Please take this...It is all of me.</text>
<text id="28000000">Well, this is a surprise. I don't get many visitors, except for
ghosts.</text>
<text id="28000001">Do you have some business here?</text>
<text id="28000002">My name is Ingward.</text>
<text id="28000003">I'm an old man, bound to these parts.</text>
<text id="28000004">But I don't mind a chat. I may even be of some help.</text>
<text id="28000100">Well, this is a surprise. I don't get many visitors, except
ghosts.</text>
<text id="28000101">Oh, cursed, are you? Is that what brings you to me?</text>
<text id="28000102">It is a wise choice. Your troubles will soon be over.</text>
<text id="28000103">My name is Ingward.</text>
<text id="28000104">I'm an old man, bound to these parts.</text>
<text id="28000105">But cleansing your curses; that I can do.</text>
<text id="28000106">The breaking of curses is the territory of deities. You must be
prepared to give some of yourself.</text>
<text id="28000200">Hello again. How are you?</text>
<text id="28000201">Oh, hello there. How are you?</text>
<text id="28000202">I don't mind a chat. I may even be of some help.</text>
<text id="28000300">Hello, there. Where have you been? I'm glad to see you well.</text>
<text id="28000301">How can I be of assistance?</text>
<text id="28000400">Well, hello there. Have you been cursed?</text>
<text id="28000401">That can be quite onerous. But not to worry.</text>
<text id="28000402">Such cleansing, I am happy to administer.</text>
<text id="28000403">But the breaking of curses is the territory of deities. You must
be prepared for sacrifice.</text>
<text id="28000500">Hello, there. Cursed again?</text>
<text id="28000501">I do not know whether you are brave, or just foolish, but you do
seem to find your share of trouble.</text>
<text id="28000502">How do you manage to find so much trouble?</text>
<text id="28000900">Hello there. What is it?</text>
<text id="28000901">The key to the seal is now in your hands. I will help you in any
way possible.</text>
<text id="28001000">...You've broken the seal, have you?...</text>
<text id="28001001">...</text>
<text id="28001002">No, I have no regrets. My trust lies with you, and Frampt.</text>
<text id="28001003">No, I have no regrets. For I trust in you.</text>
<text id="28001004">But you cannot proceed without being able to traverse the Abyss.</text>
<text id="28001100">According to legend, the knight Artorias crossed the Abyss,</text>
<text id="28001101">and annihilated the atrocious Darkwraiths.</text>
<text id="28001102">If you can find him, and learn from him, the Abyss may prove
surmountable.</text>
<text id="28001200">...Magnificent. You defeated the Four Kings.</text>
<text id="28001201">Impressive, even for a bearer of the Lordvessel.</text>
<text id="28001202">And with this, my purpose is exhausted.</text>
<text id="28001203">I have not seen the sun for a long time.</text>
<text id="28001204">Perhaps I could do with a change...</text>
<text id="28001300">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="28001301">The sunlight made me wince, and now I've come back to this dark
hole!</text>
<text id="28001302">So, what brings you here? I will help you in any way I can.</text>
<text id="28001400">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="28001401">What is it? I will help you in any way that I can.</text>
<text id="28001500">Oh, hello. You've acquired the Lordvessel, have you?</text>
<text id="28001501">Very impressive.</text>
<text id="28001502">I know exactly what your intentions are.</text>
<text id="28001503">You seek the Four Kings whom I guard over.</text>
<text id="28001504">And yes, I do have the key to the seal.</text>
<text id="28001505">But before I give it up, there is something I must ask.</text>
<text id="28001506">Do you see the great hall that stands before you?</text>
<text id="28001507">Atop it, you will find a Darkwraith, a servant of the Four Kings.</text>
<text id="28001508">Show me that you can defeat it.</text>
<text id="28001509">As guardian of the seal, it behoves me to test your strength.</text>
<text id="28001510">For if you cannot defeat the Darkwraith, you will be no match for
the Four Kings.</text>
<text id="28001511">Even if Frampt has chosen you.</text>
<text id="28001512">Even if you are the bearer of the Lordvessel.</text>
<text id="28001600">Well, this is a surprise. I get few visitors, save for ghosts.</text>
<text id="28001601">You have...the Lordvessel.</text>
<text id="28001700">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="28001701">What is it? I will help you in any way that I can.</text>
<text id="28001800">Hate to ask, really.</text>
<text id="28001801">But I am the Guardian of the Seal. I have seen too many lives
wasted over the eons.</text>
<text id="28001802">So, I had no choice but to test your mettle.</text>
<text id="28001900">You, you have defeated the Darkwraith!</text>
<text id="28001901">Very good, indeed. I can certainly trust you.</text>
<text id="28001902">This is the key to the seal.</text>
<text id="28001903">The Four Kings slumber in the deepest chamber of the ruins.</text>
<text id="28001904">Use this key to break the seal and open the floodgates.</text>
<text id="28001905">...Oh, and do not forget...</text>
<text id="28001906">The Darkwraiths reside in a dark void called the Abyss.</text>
<text id="28001907">But the Abyss is no place for ordinary mortals.</text>
<text id="28001908">Although long ago, the knight Artorias traversed the Abyss.</text>
<text id="28001909">If you can find him, and learn from him, the Abyss may prove
surmountable.</text>
<text id="28002000">I am the Guardian of the Seal.</text>
<text id="28002001">I watch over the Four Kings, the masters of the Darkwraiths.</text>
<text id="28002002">The Darkwraiths are the enemies of man, and any living thing that
has a soul.</text>
<text id="28002003">They were born in New Londo, and that is where they perished; the
entire city was sacrificed to contain them.</text>
<text id="28002004">...For that is how great a threat they were...</text>
<text id="28002100">New Londo was sacrificed to contain the Darkwraiths.</text>
<text id="28002101">Mark my words. The Darkwraiths are the enemies of man, and any
living thing that has a soul.</text>
<text id="28002102">They were never meant to roam again.</text>
<text id="28002200">Long ago, the Four Kings were powerful men. Only, their hearts
were weak.</text>
<text id="28002201">When an evil serpent dangled the art of Lifedrain before them,</text>
<text id="28002202">they were unable to resist, and became pawns of evil.</text>
<text id="28002300">What! No!</text>
<text id="28002301">What are you doing!</text>
<text id="28002302">Cease!</text>
<text id="28002303">Stop that!</text>
<text id="28002304">Sigh...</text>
<text id="28002305">You are no different from the rest...</text>
<text id="28002306">So be it! I am Ingward, the guardian of the seal.</text>
<text id="28002307">Prepare to meet your doom!</text>
<text id="28002308">Ohh...ogghh...How could I allow this...</text>
<text id="28002309">Forgive me...my countrymen...</text>
<text id="29000000">Well, you must be a new arrival.</text>
<text id="29000001">Having trouble accessing the Undead Church?</text>
<text id="29000002">Here, take this key.</text>
<text id="29000003">I won't be needing it anymore.</text>
<text id="29000004">I'm Andre, of Astora.</text>
<text id="29000005">If you require smithing, then speak to me.</text>
<text id="29000100">Well, hello again.</text>
<text id="29000101">You seem to be doing all right.</text>
<text id="29000102">Need anything forged?</text>
<text id="29000200">Most weapons and armour are mighty sturdy indeed.</text>
<text id="29000201">But every hunk of metal has its breaking point.</text>
<text id="29000202">If you notice durability running low, it's time to repair.</text>
<text id="29000203">You can ask a blacksmith like meself, or do it on your own with a
grindstone.</text>
<text id="29000204">The nice thing about weapons... they never betray you.</text>
<text id="29000205">So, pay them a little respect, eh?</text>
<text id="29000300">There are two types of weapon forging. There's reinforcement, and
there's ascension.</text>
<text id="29000301">Reinforcement is simple. It strengthens the weapon and nothing
more.</text>
<text id="29000302">A simple task for any blacksmith. Hell, you could even do it
yourself with a smithbox.</text>
<text id="29000303">But ascension's a finer art. It alters a weapon's properties.</text>
<text id="29000304">Ascension is the territory of we blacksmiths; a smithbox just
won't do the trick.</text>
<text id="29000305">Start out with reinforcement. When that loses its charm, you can
consider ascension.</text>
<text id="29000306">As you've noticed, this land is flush with the mad and wicked.</text>
<text id="29000307">You won't make it through the night without employing my
services!</text>
<text id="29000308">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="29000400">You can forge armour just like you do weapons.</text>
<text id="29000401">Reinforcement is easy enough. You only need a smithbox. But
ascension is the territory of we blacksmiths.</text>
<text id="29000402">Forging armour is even easier than forging weapons.</text>
<text id="29000403">Whether you forge weapons or armour first? Well, that's up to
you.</text>
<text id="29000404">But nobody wants to see you go Hollow.</text>
<text id="29000405">So, whatever you do, you'd better do it well!</text>
<text id="29000406">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="29000500">This is the old church.</text>
<text id="29000501">It was abandoned in favour of the church that you passed through.</text>
<text id="29000502">There are paths leading from here to two forbidden planes: Sen's
Fortress, and the Darkroot Garden.</text>
<text id="29000503">They attract all sorts of lunatics, no-one as cultured as
yourself.</text>
<text id="29000504">It's fine to be Undead, but keep a level head, eh?</text>
<text id="29000505">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="29000600">Sen's Fortress is an old proving grounds built by the ancient
gods.</text>
<text id="29000601">It is the only route leading to the great Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="29000602">Of course, most fools can't even find their way into that
fortified deathtrap.</text>
<text id="29000603">But they won't stop trying! Take that bumbling Sir Onion...</text>
<text id="29000604">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="29000700">Oi, where're you off to?</text>
<text id="29000800">What's going on with you, eh?</text>
<text id="29000801">I thought you'd gone Hollow there.</text>
<text id="29000802">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="29000900">Ow!</text>
<text id="29000950">Owww, that hurts!</text>
<text id="29001000">Well, you've got some nerve!</text>
<text id="29001001">Coming at me like that!</text>
<text id="29001002">I'll tear you to shreds! You bloody Hollow!</text>
<text id="29001100">Curses, you damn backstabber...</text>
<text id="29001200">Ahh, why, that's a fine ember you have there.</text>
<text id="29001201">I could smith some mighty weapons with one of those.</text>
<text id="29001202">Why not lend it to me?</text>
<text id="29001300">I see...'Tis a pity...</text>
<text id="29001400">Magnificent! You won't be disappointed.</text>
<text id="29001401">I can hardly wait to get started...</text>
<text id="29001450">Well, I'll be! That's a brilliant ember you've got there!</text>
<text id="29001451">For all my years in the trade, that might be the finest!</text>
<text id="29001452">How's about...you leave that ember with me?</text>
<text id="29001453">I'm just an old smith. I'd give my left arm for a gem like that!</text>
<text id="29001460">I see...'Tis a pity...</text>
<text id="29001461">But perhaps you'd...</text>
<text id="29001462">No, no, it's quite all right...</text>
<text id="29001463">Quite all right, indeed...</text>
<text id="29001470">Well! Thank you mightily for that.</text>
<text id="29001471">Now, just leave the rest to me.</text>
<text id="29001472">Andre of Astora gets the job done, you shall see!</text>
<text id="29001500">My, that's a rare ember you have there.</text>
<text id="29001501">I've seen one of those before...It's the ember of a divine
blacksmith.</text>
<text id="29001502">Might you consider leaving that with me?</text>
<text id="29001503">I could produce divine weapons with a flame such as that.</text>
<text id="29001600">I see...'Tis a pity...</text>
<text id="29001700">Well, thanks for that!</text>
<text id="29001701">You've made a fine decision. You soon shall see!</text>
<text id="29001800">Oh, my, what a brilliant ember you have there.</text>
<text id="29001801">I've only heard legends of such specimens...</text>
<text id="29001802">The embers used for the secret rites of divine blacksmiths...</text>
<text id="29001803">Perhaps you could lend it to me?</text>
<text id="29001804">I've long dreamed of forging divine weapons...</text>
<text id="29001900">I see...'Tis a pity...</text>
<text id="29001901">I can't expect you to give up what's yours.</text>
<text id="29002000">Ah-hah! Splendid, splendid! Thank you!</text>
<text id="29002001">Andre of Astora never disappoints, I assure you!</text>
<text id="29002100">Hrm? Show me that ember of yours...</text>
<text id="29002101">Well, I've never heard of a black ember.</text>
<text id="29002102">Hmmm...</text>
<text id="29002103">How about leaving that ember with me?</text>
<text id="29002104">I find it strangely fascinating..</text>
<text id="29002200">Are you sure? Well, fair enough.</text>
<text id="29002201">Tis a pity, but I'll live.</text>
<text id="29002300">Yes, well! Thank you.</text>
<text id="29002301">This ember really is something special. I'm already under its
spell.</text>
<text id="29002302">I sense great potential, indeed...</text>
<text id="29002400">Hmm, that's an odd ember you have there.</text>
<text id="29002401">Ahh, I know what you're thinking. But I'm no good with those.</text>
<text id="29002402">It won't be easy, but...</text>
<text id="29002403">I'm afraid you'll have to look for someone else.</text>
<text id="29002500">I'll be seeing you, then.</text>
<text id="29002501">Be careful out there.</text>
<text id="29002600">Don't get yourself killed.</text>
<text id="29002601">Neither of us want to see you go Hollow.</text>
<text id="29002700">I know little of the Darkroot Garden.</text>
<text id="29002701">Although I've heard rumours of a divine blacksmith who resides
there.</text>
<text id="29002702">Those who get stumped in the Catacombs seek him for divine
weapons.</text>
<text id="29002800">Oh, yes, and one other thing about the Darkroot Garden.</text>
<text id="29002801">It is said to house the grave of Sir Artorias the Abysswalker.</text>
<text id="29002802">Only, of those who ventured into the forest, none has returned.</text>
<text id="30000000">...Be gone with you!</text>
<text id="30000001">...You'll spoil my focus.</text>
<text id="30000100">...What's that, then? Need some smithing?</text>
<text id="30000101">Then produce me some wares!</text>
<text id="30000300">Well, what was that about?</text>
<text id="30000301">Don't be coming around here without a good reason!</text>
<text id="30000400">If that'll be all, then be gone with you!</text>
<text id="30000401">...You'll spoil my focus.</text>
<text id="30000500">Now where've you gone?</text>
<text id="30000600">...You've got rotten manners.</text>
<text id="30000601">If it be smithing you need, then produce your wares.</text>
<text id="30000700">Bah!</text>
<text id="30000750">You rotten scoundrel!</text>
<text id="30000800">Trying to cause trouble, are you?</text>
<text id="30000801">I am Vamos the blacksmith, and I'm no bag of bones!</text>
<text id="30000900">Curses...</text>
<text id="30001000">...Hmph? Why, is that...</text>
<text id="30001001">...An ember from New Londo...</text>
<text id="30001002">...And a fine ember it be...</text>
<text id="30001003">What do you say? Why not leave it with me?</text>
<text id="30001004">I'll give you a flame to feast your eyes upon.</text>
<text id="30001100">Hmm, hmm, yes, yes, I see...</text>
<text id="30001101">Well, do not hesitate if you should change your mind...</text>
<text id="30001200">Yes, yes, very well! We'll get these old bones to work!</text>
<text id="30001201">Keh heh heh!</text>
<text id="30001300">...Hmph? Why, that's...</text>
<text id="30001301">...an ember unlike any that I have seen...</text>
<text id="30001302">...a very curious pattern...</text>
<text id="30001303">...Could it be the flame of the legendary witch?</text>
<text id="30001304">...I know! Suppose you left that ember with me?</text>
<text id="30001305">Old Vamos would never let you down, no, not ever!</text>
<text id="30001400">Hmm, hmm...Fine, then...</text>
<text id="30001401">I doubt you'd even...bah, forget it...</text>
<text id="30001402">These bones won't fail me anytime soon. I'll come across another,
eventually...</text>
<text id="30001500">Keh heh heh heh heh!</text>
<text id="30001501">Yes, splendid, splendid indeed!</text>
<text id="30001502">...My, oh, my! You precious little thing...</text>
<text id="30001600">...Hmph? Why, you have...</text>
<text id="30001601">...an ember, do you?</text>
<text id="30001602">Ahh, forget about it. I don't deal with that kind.</text>
<text id="30001603">What has gone wrong with embers these days?</text>
<text id="30001700">...Hmph! I'm here to smith, not to chit chat.</text>
<text id="30001800">...I've told you, I'm here for the trade, not for the talk!</text>
<text id="30001900">Enough with your presence. It disturbs me.</text>
<text id="30002000">Well, you are a persistent one, are you not? </text>
<text id="30002001">But I'm afraid I'm a mere blacksmith, it's just me and my trade.</text>
<text id="30002002">I would be of no help to a righteous warrior such as yourself.</text>
<text id="30002100">I've told you, I have nothing to discuss...</text>
<text id="30002101">If I have anything to offer, it's my smithing, and nothing more.</text>
<text id="30002102">I'd be of more help with that ember from New Londo, of course...</text>
<text id="30002103">It's a shame the whole place was flooded...</text>
<text id="30002200">I've told you, I have nothing to discuss...</text>
<text id="30002201">If I have anything to offer, it's my smithing, and nothing more.</text>
<text id="30002202">Speaking honestly, I must say that I'm at my very limit. There's
no more work to be done.</text>
<text id="30002203">Ahh, unless I had the flame of that legendary witch...</text>
<text id="30002204">But that would require a visit to Lost Izalith. Impossible...</text>
<text id="31000000">Who are you?</text>
<text id="31000001">Forge your weapons?</text>
<text id="31000100">Mng. Hello.</text>

<text id="31001602">we talk.</text>
<text id="31001603">You good friend.</text>
<text id="31001604">I very happy.</text>
<text id="31001700">You weak.</text>
<text id="32000000">Hrm?</text>
<text id="32000001">Well, this is unusual. You haven't lost your head.</text>
<text id="32000002">And more importantly, you're free. How on earth...</text>
<text id="32000003">...Well, I shouldn't pry.</text>
<text id="32000004">I am Rickert of Vinheim.</text>
<text id="32000005">I was once an established smith, but look at me now.</text>
<text id="32000006">Can you believe it?</text>
<text id="32000020">Hm? What is it?</text>
<text id="32000021">Have you...Oh, no, don't worry. I've no intention of escape.</text>
<text id="32000022">It's safe here. I can't bear the thought of going Hollow out
there.</text>
<text id="32000023">Although, I must admit, I've not much to occupy myself.</text>
<text id="32000024">How about this? I could forge your weapons, albeit with rather
minimal tools.</text>
<text id="32000025">I will show you what made me the best in Vinheim!</text>
<text id="32000030">Hm? What is it?</text>
<text id="32000031">Normally I wouldn't bother, but...</text>
<text id="32000032">I must admit, I've not much to occupy myself.</text>
<text id="32000033">How about this? I could forge your weapons, albeit with rather
minimal tools.</text>
<text id="32000034">I will show you what made me the best in Vinheim!</text>
<text id="32000100">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="32000101">What weapons have you brought? Go on; show me.</text>
<text id="32000150">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="32000151">I was beginning to wonder when you'd come.</text>
<text id="32000152">Have you materials? Go on, show me.</text>
<text id="32000200">Come back soon.</text>
<text id="32000201">Smithing helps soothe my nerves.</text>
<text id="32000202">Don't let me wither away out of idleness!</text>
<text id="32000300">Good-bye, then.</text>
<text id="32000301">Keep your head on, out there.</text>
<text id="32000302">You really help break the monotony.</text>
<text id="32000400">Hm? What's happened?</text>
<text id="32000500">What was that about?</text>
<text id="32000501">Ahh, it doesn't matter.</text>
<text id="32000660">What's got into you!</text>
<text id="32000700">Damn, you've gone Hollow, have you?</text>
<text id="32000701">Forget about it! I have nothing more to say.</text>
<text id="32000702">Be gone!</text>
<text id="32000703">Oh, go away!</text>
<text id="32000704">There's nothing here for you. Nothing at all.</text>
<text id="32000800">No...impossible...</text>
<text id="32000801">Why didn't I see?</text>
<text id="32000802">...You've gone Hollow...</text>
<text id="32000900">Hey, hang on...</text>
<text id="32000901">That's a sorcery ember...isn't it?</text>
<text id="32000902">Yes, it certainly is...The first I've seen since my banishment
from Vinheim.</text>
<text id="32000903">What do you say, friend? Mind giving that to me?</text>
<text id="32000904">This is no-man's land. I'm the only one who could handle it
anyway.</text>
<text id="32001000">...Yes, I see. All right, fine.</text>
<text id="32001001">But I don't think you're really seeing things clearly.</text>
<text id="32001100">Yes, as you should!</text>
<text id="32001101">I won't disappoint you. I'm taskless no longer!</text>
<text id="32001200">Hey, hang on...</text>
<text id="32001201">Is that...a sorcery ember?</text>
<text id="32001202">I've never seen one like that, not even back in Vinheim.</text>
<text id="32001203">What a brilliant flame!</text>
<text id="32001204">Please, friend, let me have that. I am begging you.</text>
<text id="32001205">I am a craftsman of Vinheim. I'd go Hollow before I pass up a
flame like that!</text>
<text id="32001300">...Fine.</text>
<text id="32001301">...Fine, I won't bother you.</text>
<text id="32001302">It was wonderful if only to gaze upon.</text>
<text id="32001303">It takes me back to old times.</text>
<text id="32001400">Oh, really! You are wonderful!</text>
<text id="32001401">I will forge a Rickert masterpiece, just for you!</text>
<text id="32001402">A weapon to make a legend out of you...</text>
<text id="32001500">Hey, hang on...</text>
<text id="32001501">Is that an ember?</text>
<text id="32001502">Oh, no, I'm sorry. We of Vinheim don't deal in shoddy embers like
that.</text>
<text id="32001503">Perhaps you should try an old smith out in the country.</text>
<text id="32001600">Hm? What is it?</text>
<text id="32001601">There's nothing to talk about.</text>
<text id="32001602">We're both cursed; Undead. But what's there, really, to moan
about?</text>
<text id="32001700">Old Big Hat? Of course I've heard of him.</text>
<text id="32001701">Who hasn't in Vinheim?</text>
<text id="32001702">He was a royal member of Dragon School, until he turned Undead.</text>
<text id="32001703">I hear he was quite the character...Only, that was a hundred
years ago.</text>
<text id="32001704">What interest have you in the old eccentric now?</text>
<text id="32001800">Sorcery? Don't ask me how it actually works.</text>
<text id="32001801">We only fiddle and forge, until it works itself in.</text>
<text id="32001802">That's how we do it in Vinheim, at least.</text>
<text id="32001803">We prefer to leave the theorizing to those uppity scholars.</text>
<text id="33000000">Well, now...</text>
<text id="33000001">You seem to have your wits about you, hmm?</text>
<text id="33000002">Then you are a welcome customer!</text>
<text id="33000003">I trade for souls. Everything's for sale!</text>
<text id="33000004">Nee hee hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="33000100">Oh, you again?</text>
<text id="33000101">I hope you've brought plenty of souls?</text>
<text id="33000102">Nee hee hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="33000120">Oh, there you are.</text>
<text id="33000121">Still keeping your marbles all together?</text>
<text id="33000122">Then, go ahead, don't be a nitwit.</text>
<text id="33000123">Never hurts to splurge when your days are numbered!</text>
<text id="33000124">Nee hee hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="33000140">Oh, there you are.</text>
<text id="33000141">Where have you been hiding?</text>
<text id="33000142">I guessed you'd hopped the twig for certain.</text>
<text id="33000143">Bah, shows what I know!</text>
<text id="33000144">Nee hee hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="33000200">Hmph!</text>
<text id="33000201">Cheap bastard.</text>
<text id="33000202">If you're looking for a lot, you have to give a little.</text>
<text id="33000203">Right, Yulia?</text>
<text id="33000220">Tsk!</text>
<text id="33000221">Throw me a bone, will you?</text>
<text id="33000222">You haven't got much time anyway.</text>
<text id="33000223">Right, Yulia?</text>
<text id="33000240">Hmph.</text>
<text id="33000241">What a waste of time.</text>
<text id="33000242">Go and fall off a cliff. </text>
<text id="33000300">Thank you kindly.</text>
<text id="33000301">Nee hee hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="33000320">Ah, thank you, very much.</text>
<text id="33000321">Come back soon!</text>
<text id="33000322">Nee hee hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="33000400">Hey, what! What's the matter?</text>
<text id="33000500">What was that about?</text>
<text id="33000501">Oh, nevermind.</text>
<text id="33000600">Eeg!</text>
<text id="33000610">Yeowch!</text>
<text id="33000620">Oi, what's this about?</text>
<text id="33000630">It's me! Stop it, I tell you!</text>
<text id="33000700">You've gone mad, have you!?</text>
<text id="33000701">I'll teach you! You lousy rat!</text>
<text id="33000702">Yulia! Yulia!</text>
<text id="33000800">Why, me...</text>
<text id="33000801">Little Yulia...</text>
<text id="33000900">Ah, this one? Ain't she lovely?</text>
<text id="33000901">Her name is Yulia. She's plumb in love with me.</text>
<text id="33000902">You'd never leave my side, now would you, Yulia?</text>
<text id="33001000">Ah, you can forget it.</text>
<text id="33001001">I'm all that she needs.</text>
<text id="33001002">Careful, she'll bite your little fingers off!</text>
<text id="33001003">Be kind, Yulia, be kind!</text>
<text id="33001004">Nee hee hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="33001100">Eh? My wares?</text>
<text id="33001101">Of course they're stolen; what did you think?</text>
<text id="33001102">And when you lose your head,</text>
<text id="33001103">I'll sell it all again!</text>
<text id="33001104">Nee hee hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="33001200">Now, don't squander your time chatting!</text>
<text id="33001201">You need to look over my wares!</text>
<text id="33001300">Eh? I'm not here to chit-chat.</text>
<text id="33001301">We talk business, or we talk nothing at all.</text>
<text id="33001400">Things are getting treacherous in these parts.</text>
<text id="33001401">A horrible goat demon has moved in below.</text>
<text id="33001402">And up above, there's that humungous drake, and a bull demon,
too.</text>
<text id="33001403">If you stick around this place, it might end up being your grave!</text>
<text id="33001404">Nee hee hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="33001500">It's actually quite nice here, you know?</text>
<text id="33001501">The Hollows don't care for a skinny old twig like me.</text>
<text id="33001502">I've got Yulia...And nobody pelts me with stones anymore.</text>
<text id="33001503">You're Undead, you know how it is.</text>
<text id="33001504">I was treated worse back at home.</text>
<text id="34000000">Hmm, you still have your senses about you?</text>
<text id="34000001">Then why won't you buy some of my moss?</text>
<text id="34000002">I need your souls!</text>
<text id="34000003">Vee hee hee!</text>
<text id="34000100">Oh, there you are, dearie!</text>
<text id="34000101">A pleasure to see you again.</text>
<text id="34000102">Vee hee hee!</text>
<text id="34000120">Oh, there you are, dearie!</text>
<text id="34000121">I have moss; now dish up some souls!</text>
<text id="34000122">Vee hee hee!</text>
<text id="34000140">Oh, hello, dearie.</text>
<text id="34000141">You left me high and dry for a while, there.</text>
<text id="34000142">I thought maybe you'd forgotten about me.</text>
<text id="34000143">Are you back for more of my moss, then?</text>
<text id="34000144">Plenty of it here. Freshly peeled, just for you!</text>
<text id="34000145">Vee hee hee!</text>
<text id="34000200">Drat.</text>
<text id="34000201">What a humdrum lad you are.</text>
<text id="34000202">What a humdrum lass you are.</text>
<text id="34000220">Hmph, fine, then.</text>
<text id="34000221">But you'll regret it.</text>
<text id="34000240">Are you toying with me?</text>
<text id="34000241">One day, your fate will catch up with you.</text>
<text id="34000242">I have a sense for these things...</text>
<text id="34000243">The Gods above are watching you!</text>
<text id="34000300">Come again, if you please!</text>
<text id="34000301">Vee hee hee!</text>
<text id="34000320">Much obliged.</text>
<text id="34000321">I think I like you!</text>
<text id="34000322">Vee hee hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="34000400">Don't run off!</text>
<text id="34000500">What's the matter with you!</text>
<text id="34000501">Don't you toy with my nerves!</text>
<text id="34000600">Why, you!</text>
<text id="34000610">Stop that!</text>
<text id="34000620">Ouch!</text>
<text id="34000630">Eeek!</text>
<text id="34000700">What do you think you're doing?!</text>
<text id="34000701">I have my pride, you damn fool!</text>
<text id="34000702">You think you can get away with murder?</text>
<text id="34000703">Yes, I suppose you think you're special!</text>
<text id="34000704">Well, you're not! You're just another customer!</text>
<text id="34000705">Burn! Burn in hell!</text>
<text id="34000706">You cross-eyed Hollow!</text>
<text id="34000707">There's no hope for anyone like you! The Gods will not have it!</text>
<text id="34000708">Die! Die!</text>
<text id="34000709">Die! Die!</text>
<text id="34000710">Die a thousand times again!</text>
<text id="34000711">Curses upon you!</text>
<text id="34000712">Upon you, and yours,</text>
<text id="34000713">for generations eternal!</text>
<text id="34000714">All of you!</text>
<text id="34000715">Eternal pain and suffering!</text>
<text id="34000716">Lots and lots!</text>
<text id="34000800">A curse upon you...</text>
<text id="34000900">You've come to this land at a bad time.</text>
<text id="34000901">There are nothing but Hollows in these parts. Save for me, of
course.</text>
<text id="34000902">You're Undead, too, aren't you? You be careful, then.</text>
<text id="34000903">Vee hee hee!</text>
<text id="34001000">I forage moss.</text>
<text id="34001001">In the lower areas of this town, you'll find all kinds of poison
and pestilence.</text>
<text id="34001002">You can't travel a stone's toss without some trusty moss.</text>
<text id="34001003">Make sure you take plenty with you!</text>
<text id="34001004">Vee hee hee!</text>
<text id="34001100">Ah, go down along the side to reach the depths of the Undead
Burg.</text>
<text id="34001101">Only unkempt crooks and liars to be found there.</text>
<text id="34001102">Hardly a place for a lady like myself!</text>
<text id="34001103">But who knows, maybe you'd fit right in?</text>
<text id="34001104">Vee hee hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="34001200">This is a wonderful place, don't you think?</text>
<text id="34001201">We have water, moss, moisture, these nice iron bars...</text>
<text id="34001202">I like it here, I really do.</text>
<text id="34001203">Nothing good ever happened to me in life.</text>
<text id="34001204">But now that I'm Undead, I've never been happier!</text>
<text id="34001300">Tell me honestly...</text>
<text id="34001301">You think I've gone to the other side, don't you?</text>
<text id="34001302">That I've cracked my head and gone Hollow...</text>
<text id="34001303">You do, don't you?</text>
<text id="34001304">I can see it in your eyes.</text>
<text id="34001305">You'd trust a patch of moss over me...</text>
<text id="35000000">...Hrrg...</text>
<text id="35000001">...Rrgggg...</text>
<text id="35000002">...Rrrrrgggg...</text>
<text id="35000003">...Hrrrggaaaagghhh...</text>
<text id="35000004">...think, think...remember...remember</text>
<text id="35000005">...remember...count, count...yeah count...count</text>
<text id="35000006">...one, two, three, four, five, six, seven...argh...hrgggg</text>
<text id="35000007">...Hrrgggggggg!!</text>
<text id="35000100">...</text>
<text id="35000101">Ah, what? What? Who are you?</text>
<text id="35000102">Ahh, another Undead, eh? I took on Sen's Fortress alone...</text>
<text id="35000103">But I'm no different from those vile creatures...I was driven by
conceit...</text>
<text id="35000104">Ahh, you think you're different? That you can handle it?</text>
<text id="35000105">Yes, I remember that feeling. For I was the same.</text>
<text id="35000106">...So, let me help you out. With your soul-searching.</text>
<text id="35000200">...</text>
<text id="35000201">Hm...Oh, yes, it's you.</text>
<text id="35000202">What is it? Still something you need, eh, anything at all?</text>
<text id="35000203">What is it?</text>
<text id="35000220">...</text>
<text id="35000221">Hm, ah, oh you?</text>
<text id="35000222">Still alive? That's a surprise.</text>
<text id="35000223">Anything you want? What's mine is yours, but at a price!</text>
<text id="35000300">Nothing at all?</text>
<text id="35000301">Fine then, rush in like a naked babe, and be skinned alive!</text>
<text id="35000320">So, you're that good? Don't need a thing?</text>
<text id="35000321">Bah. It won't be long, before you're begging for mercy.</text>
<text id="35000400">Go along, try and make something of yourself.</text>
<text id="35000401">But nothing will come of it. And I should know!</text>
<text id="35000420">There you go, another brave soul.</text>
<text id="35000421">But soon you shall see...You and I are no different...</text>
<text id="35000422">Yes, yes, you soon shall see...</text>
<text id="35000423">...the putrid fate we both share...</text>
<text id="35000500">...Hmm?</text>
<text id="35000600">...Hm, fine, fine. I understand.</text>
<text id="35000601">I have my head about me.</text>
<text id="35000700">Hrgro!</text>
<text id="35000720">Hrgrah!</text>
<text id="35000740">Hrgroah!</text>
<text id="35000760">Hrgaw!</text>
<text id="35000800">What the devil's got into you!</text>
<text id="35000801">Hrrgrrrroooggh!</text>
<text id="35000802">You hrggraaaghh!</text>
<text id="35000900">Hrrggahh...</text>
<text id="35000901">Ahhh...help me...</text>
<text id="35001000">There's nothing more to say.</text>
<text id="35001001">I'm finished. We're both on the brink, you see?</text>
<text id="35001002">End of story. You bloody fool.</text>
<text id="35001100">Let me give you a nibble of advice.</text>
<text id="35001101">Don't even consider visiting Anor Londo. Not in your state.</text>
<text id="35001102">For a century, they have tried, and failed.</text>
<text id="35001103">The Knight King Rendal, Black Iron Tarkus, and even Logan
himself.</text>
<text id="35001104">You won't stand a chance. You'll be eaten alive.</text>
<text id="35001105">But, go along, if you wish. If only to deepen your despair!</text>
<text id="35001200">Where do I get all my things?</text>
<text id="35001201">Stripped off the corpses of fools like yourself.</text>
<text id="35001202">It isn't easy. I have to catch them just before they go Hollow.</text>
<text id="35001203">Don't worry. I'll be there to claim your trinkets. Gazing at your
final twisted grimace!</text>
<text id="35001204">Gee hee hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="36000000">Aye, siwmae.</text>
<text id="36000001">And good day to you.</text>
<text id="36000002">I'm Domhnall of Zena.</text>
<text id="36000003">I'm just, well, a peddler, of sorts.</text>
<text id="36000004">I adore trinkets and oddities, so I trade for them.</text>
<text id="36000100">Aye, siwmae.</text>
<text id="36000101">We meet again.</text>
<text id="36000102">Found anything special for my good self?</text>
<text id="36000103">Mmm, I certainly hope so!</text>
<text id="36000200">Aye, siwmae.</text>
<text id="36000201">Never thought I'd see you here.</text>
<text id="36000202">This feels karmaic. Pray tell, what do you have for me?</text>
<text id="36000300">Aye, siwmae.</text>
<text id="36000301">I didn't expect to meet anybody here.</text>
<text id="36000302">I suppose great minds think alike, eh? Heh heh.</text>
<text id="36000400">Thank you. That was a fine trade.</text>
<text id="36000401">I have this funny feeling we'll meet again soon.</text>
<text id="36000402">And we'll make another fine trade, of course!</text>
<text id="36000500">Well, that is a shame, then.</text>
<text id="36000501">But no matter. No, not to worry.</text>
<text id="36000502">Come back again. I'm always available.</text>
<text id="36000503">Not every trade was meant to be.</text>
<text id="36000504">There'll be more in store for us, someday, sometime!</text>
<text id="36000600">Hold on, there!</text>
<text id="36000610">What's this about?</text>
<text id="36000620">Now, stop that!</text>
<text id="36000630">Ouch!</text>
<text id="36000640">Oww!</text>
<text id="36000700">What problem do you have now?</text>
<text id="36000710">I'm a man of peace, idiot!</text>
<text id="36000720">Enough of you, I say, farewell.</text>
<text id="36000800">By the Lords...why...</text>
<text id="36000810">My precious collection...</text>
<text id="36000900">Hmm...</text>
<text id="36000901">I'm afraid I don't see anything here.</text>
<text id="36001000">Hmm...</text>
<text id="36001001">Well, I'm certain we will make a good trade eventually...</text>
<text id="36001002">So, I am willing to share some tips.</text>
<text id="36001003">If you seek Kindling in the Catacombs, use divine weapons.</text>
<text id="36001004">That will repel the reassembling skeletons.</text>
<text id="36001100">Hmm...</text>
<text id="36001101">Well, I'm certain we will make a good trade eventually...</text>
<text id="36001102">So, I am willing to share some tips.</text>
<text id="36001103">The cursed Ghosts of New Londo are formidable foes.</text>
<text id="36001104">To face them, you will require special arms...Or a cursed body.</text>
<text id="36001105">The quickest way to be cursed? Try the bug-eyed lizards in the
sewer.</text>
<text id="36001106">Desperate measures, to be sure...</text>
<text id="36001200">Hmm...</text>
<text id="36001201">You are a fine trading partner.</text>
<text id="36001202">Rumour it may be, but I have heard of a surviving ancient dragon
who resides in this land.</text>
<text id="36001203">A coterie of Undead serves the dragon, as they train to become
dragons themselves.</text>
<text id="36001204">Sounds unlikely, but you never know, do you?</text>
<text id="37000000">Well, what do we have here? You must be a new arrival.</text>
<text id="37000001">Let me guess. Fate of the Undead, right? Well, you're not the
first.</text>
<text id="37000002">But there's no salvation here. You'd have done better to rot in
the Undead Asylum... But, too late now.</text>
<text id="37000003">Well, since you're here... Let me help you out.</text>
<text id="37000004">There are actually two Bells of Awakening.</text>
<text id="37000005">One's up above, in the Undead Church. The other is far, far
below, in the ruins at the base of Blighttown.</text>
<text id="37000006">Ring them both, and something happens... Brilliant, right?</text>
<text id="37000007">Not much to go on, but I have a feeling that won't stop you.</text>
<text id="37000008">So, off you go. It is why you came, isn't it? To this accursed
land of the Undead?</text>
<text id="37000009">Hah hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="37000100">Hm? What, you want to hear more?</text>
<text id="37000101">Oh, that's all we need. Another inquisitive soul.</text>
<text id="37000102">Well, listen carefully, then...</text>
<text id="37000103">One of the bells is up above in the Undead Church, but the lift
is broken.</text>
<text id="37000104">You'll have to climb the stairs up the ruins, and access the
Undead Burg through the waterway.</text>
<text id="37000105">The other bell is back down below the Undead Burg,</text>
<text id="37000106">within the plague-infested Blighttown.</text>
<text id="37000107">But I'd die again before I step foot in that cesspool!</text>
<text id="37000108">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="37000200">Bloody hell, what is it now?</text>
<text id="37000201">You ask too many questions.</text>
<text id="37000300">What's wrong? Get a bit of a scare out there?</text>
<text id="37000301">No problem. Have a seat and get comfortable.</text>
<text id="37000302">We'll both be Hollow before you know it.</text>
<text id="37000303">Hah hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="37000400">Why, what a surprise. I didn't expect you to make it.</text>
<text id="37000401">...Oh, somebody rang the bell...Wait. Was it you?</text>
<text id="37000402">You never give up, do you? I don't know how you do it.</text>
<text id="37000403">Well, don't stop now. Only one more, but it's going to be
suicide.</text>
<text id="37000404">Only one more now, if you have the heart for it.</text>
<text id="37000405">Hah hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="37000500">Did you see that hoity-toity cleric? He went through the
graveyard and down into the Catacombs.</text>
<text id="37000501">Clerics speak of some nonsense called Kindling, used to feed
bonfires.</text>
<text id="37000502">They're so bloody determined. They practically queue to explore
the Catacombs.</text>
<text id="37000503">Hah hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="37000600">Have you been to the ruins of New Londo below?</text>
<text id="37000601">Just head down the stairs, and take the lift.</text>
<text id="37000602">It's certainly worth a visit.</text>
<text id="37000603">It was once an Undead city. You may find a clue or two.</text>
<text id="37000604">Unless the ghosts find you first...</text>
<text id="37000605">Keh heh heh heh!</text>
<text id="37000700">How did that silly sorcerer's apprentice end up?</text>
<text id="37000701">You know, the one always prattling on about Master Logan.</text>
<text id="37000702">He left for the Undead Burg, but never came back.</text>
<text id="37000703">Serves him right. If even Old Big Hat can't make it out there,
what chance does he have?</text>
<text id="37000704">I hope he enjoys his new life as a Hollow.</text>
<text id="37000800">How did that raggedy old chum end up?</text>
<text id="37000801">You know, the one who idolized some godmother of pyromancy.</text>
<text id="37000802">He left for Blighttown, but never came back.</text>
<text id="37000803">Whereas most flee from sickness, he dives right in.</text>
<text id="37000804">Well, nothing will harm him once he goes Hollow.</text>
<text id="37000900">That cleric was spared?</text>
<text id="37000901">I never know what the Gods are thinking...</text>
<text id="37000902">Tsk!</text>
<text id="37001000">How did that nutty sorcerer make it back?</text>
<text id="37001001">Unexpected, but I suppose stranger things have happened.</text>
<text id="37001100">How did that old man make it back?</text>
<text id="37001101">Unexpected, but I suppose stranger things have happened.</text>
<text id="37001200">Don't you ever think to forge your weapons?</text>
<text id="37001201">Perhaps you haven't heard of Andre. Visit him in the Old Church,
in the forest behind the Undead Church.</text>
<text id="37001202">Perhaps you haven't heard of Andre. You really need to find him.</text>
<text id="37001203">Unless you enjoy swinging about with blunt instruments!</text>
<text id="37001204">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="37001300">Oh, have you seen that terribly morose lass?</text>
<text id="37001301">...The Fire Keeper.</text>
<text id="37001302">She's stuck keeping that bonfire lit.</text>
<text id="37001303">Sad, really. She's mute and bound to this forsaken place.</text>
<text id="37001304">They probably cut her tongue out back in her village, so that
she'd never say any god's name in vain.</text>
<text id="37001305">How do these martyrs keep chugging along? I'd peter out in an
instant.</text>
<text id="37001306">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="37001400">Oh, your face! You're practically Hollow.</text>
<text id="37001401">It won't be long, if you keep dying like this. You'd best hurry
and restore your humanity.</text>
<text id="37001402">But who knows, going Hollow could solve quite a bit!</text>
<text id="37001403">Hah hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="37001500">Hm, what? Restoring your humanity?</text>
<text id="37001501">Well, there are a few ways to go about it...</text>
<text id="37001502">Collect it bit by bit from corpses,</text>
<text id="37001503">Collect it bit by bit from corpses, or you can butter up a
cleric, and get yourself summoned.</text>
<text id="37001504">And the quickest way, although I'd never do it, is to kill a
healthy Undead, and pillage its humanity. </text>
<text id="37001505">Coveting thy neighbour is only human, after all!</text>
<text id="37001506">Hah hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="37001600">What are you looking at?</text>
<text id="37001601">Don't try anything clever. You might regret it.</text>
<text id="37001700">Oi, hold on...Don't tell me, have you been cursed?</text>
<text id="37001701">Oh woe is the Undead who's cursed on top of it all! Harsh times;
harsh times, indeed!</text>
<text id="37001702">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="37001703">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="37001704">No, no, I'm sorry. Here, let me share a nice tip.</text>
<text id="37001705">Long ago, I was told of a remedician who resides in New Londo.</text>
<text id="37001706">Does he really exist? Well, go and find out for yourself.</text>
<text id="37001707">But don't blame me if he's just an apparition!</text>
<text id="37001708">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="37001709">Oi, did you see him?</text>
<text id="37001800">Big Hat Logan, the legendary sorcerer, in the flesh!</text>
<text id="37001801">...This place is simply mad...Legendary heroes popping up left
and right...</text>
<text id="37001802">They're making me feel quite inadequate, to be honest!</text>
<text id="37001803">Hah hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="37001900">Did you see her?</text>
<text id="37001901">That virtuous little maiden, complete with followers in tow.</text>
<text id="37001902">They're probably going straight to pillage graves. I've heard
enough about "M'Lady" for a lifetime.</text>
<text id="37001903">What absolute rubbish, eh?</text>
<text id="37001904">Tsk!</text>
<text id="37002000">Did you hear about the maiden?</text>
<text id="37002001">The virtuous lass came back alone, and in absolute tatters...</text>
<text id="37002002">Did her followers die, or was she abandoned? Who knows.</text>
<text id="37002003">But I suppose we've heard the last from "M'lady".</text>
<text id="37002004">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="37002100">That maiden?</text>
<text id="37002101">She's shuffled off somewhere. I believe to the Undead Church.</text>
<text id="37002102">These ruins were probably too awkward for her.</text>
<text id="37002200">Did you ring the second bell?</text>
<text id="37002201">That is incredible, I must say...But now we have a new problem.</text>
<text id="37002202">It's noisy, it snores, and its breath is lethal...</text>
<text id="37002203">This is no laughing matter, I tell you.</text>
<text id="37002300">Damn, that stench...And I was really beginning to like it here!</text>
<text id="37002301">Sigh...</text>
<text id="37002302">Maybe it's time I do something about it...</text>
<text id="37002400">You again?</text>
<text id="37002401">There's nothing to speak about, really.</text>
<text id="37002402">Oh, actually...Something strange did happen.</text>
<text id="37002403">That crow flew off with somebody in its clutches. I think it was
a man curled up in a ball.</text>
<text id="37002404">Stranger things have happened, right?</text>
<text id="37002405">No, maybe not...</text>
<text id="37002500">Hm? What now?</text>
<text id="37002501">I'm not up for chatting. Leave me alone.</text>
<text id="37002600">Well, what are you going to do?</text>
<text id="37002601">I've already decided.</text>
<text id="37002602">I don't really care; I'm simply crestfallen...</text>
<text id="37002700">Ooph!</text>
<text id="37002710">Oww!</text>
<text id="37002720">What in the...!</text>
<text id="37002730">Stop that! Oi!</text>
<text id="37002800">Lousy rat! You have some nerve!</text>
<text id="37002801">I may be crestfallen, but I'm not defenceless, you rascal!</text>
<text id="37002802">You will soon regret this!</text>
<text id="37002900">Heheh, not too shabby...</text>
<text id="37002901">I think you've done me a favour...</text>
<text id="37003000">Now, that's just embarrassing.</text>
<text id="37003001">How'd you let me do that to you?</text>
<text id="37003100">Don't you ever think to forge your weapons?</text>
<text id="37003101">You'd better find a smithbox soon,</text>
<text id="37003102">Unless you enjoy swinging about with blunt instruments!</text>
<text id="37003103">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="37003104">Don't you ever repair your weapons?</text>
<text id="37003105">You just need the right tools, or some powder.</text>
<text id="37003106">If you keep swinging those scraps around, you'll be mistaken for
a Hollow!</text>
<text id="37003107">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="38000000">Mmm...</text>
<text id="38000001">Hrmmmmm...</text>
<text id="38000100">Mmm...mmm...</text>
<text id="38000101">Mm! Oh-hoh!</text>
<text id="38000102">Forgive me. I was absorbed in thought.</text>
<text id="38000103">I am Siegmeyer of Catarina.</text>
<text id="38000104">Quite honestly, I have run flat up against a wall.</text>
<text id="38000105">Or, a gate, I should say. The thing just won't budge.</text>
<text id="38000106">No matter how long I wait. And, oh, have I waited!</text>
<text id="38000107">So, here I sit, in quite a pickle.</text>
<text id="38000108">Weighing my options, so to speak!</text>
<text id="38000109">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="38000200">Still closed...</text>
<text id="38000201">Still closed...</text>
<text id="38000202">Mmm...</text>
<text id="38000400">Yeeg!</text>
<text id="38000420">Whoa!</text>
<text id="38000440">Wha!</text>
<text id="38000460">Why, are you...!</text>
<text id="38000500">That's your game, is it?</text>
<text id="38000501">Well, I'm certainly not backing down!</text>
<text id="38000502">By the honour of my knighthood!</text>
<text id="38000600">Heavens, me...</text>
<text id="38000601">My dear little Lin...</text>
<text id="38000700">Mmm...mmm...</text>
<text id="38000701">Mm! Oh-hoh!</text>
<text id="38000702">Ahh, where did you come from? Splendid news, I tell you.</text>
<text id="38000703">First, I hear a great roar. And, voila! The path is open.</text>
<text id="38000704">Just goes to show. Good things come to those who wait!</text>
<text id="38000705">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="38000800">Mn, mmm...Ah, so you see my plight?</text>
<text id="38000801">Yes, indeed, I have run up against a wall.</text>
<text id="38000802">...Or, a ball, to be precise.</text>
<text id="38000803">...I'm afraid I'm a bit too plump to be outrunning those things.</text>
<text id="38000804">So, here I sit, in quite a pickle.</text>
<text id="38000805">But who knows? Perhaps we'll have another development?</text>
<text id="38000806">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="38000900">Perhaps I could try some rolling...</text>
<text id="38000901">...Bah, no chance. My head would spin.</text>
<text id="38000902">Mmm...</text>
<text id="38010000">Mmm...</text>
<text id="38010001">Hrmmmmm...</text>
<text id="38010002">Whatever can be done?</text>
<text id="38010100">Ah, you again!</text>
<text id="38010101">Let me guess. Were you repelled by the Silver Knights?</text>
<text id="38010102">Aww, don't be ashamed. 'Tis the fate of vanguards like you and I.</text>
<text id="38010103">I'll think of something. We can overcome this, together!</text>
<text id="38010200">This is quite a fix...</text>
<text id="38010201">We'll need another three, no, maybe five bodies...</text>
<text id="38010202">Hmm...quite a fix indeed...</text>
<text id="38010300">Mmm...mmm...</text>
<text id="38010301">Mm! Oh-hoh!</text>
<text id="38010302">What's on your mind, friend?</text>
<text id="38010303">Wait!...You defeated those monsters?!</text>
<text id="38010304">Fantastic...I am saved. This knight of Catarina hereby commends
you!</text>
<text id="38010305">Take this, as a token of my gratitude.</text>
<text id="38010306">But be warned, gallantry entails great risks.</text>
<text id="38010307">Next time, give me a chance to come up with a plan.</text>
<text id="38020000">Mmm...mmm...</text>
<text id="38020001">Mm! Oh-hoh!</text>
<text id="38020002">There you are! What a pleasure!</text>
<text id="38020003">Well, look at me. Trapped like a mouse.</text>
<text id="38020004">But, don't lose any sleep over me.</text>
<text id="38020005">I'm very focused, sitting here, so very still.</text>
<text id="38020006">Something good is bound to happen soon!</text>
<text id="38020007">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="38020100">I require a key to exit.</text>
<text id="38020101">But the key is on the outside...</text>
<text id="38020102">Hmm...I'm in quite a fix...</text>
<text id="38020300">Ahh! There you are! Bless you!</text>
<text id="38020301">You seem to help me at every turn.</text>
<text id="38020302">This knight of Catarina expresses his deepest gratitude.</text>
<text id="38020303">Please take this, as a token of my appreciation.</text>
<text id="38020304">I didn't expect you to show up.</text>
<text id="38020305">Although, maybe I did!</text>
<text id="38020306">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="38020400">Ahh, hello, there.</text>
<text id="38020401">I'm going to take it slowly here, at least for now.</text>
<text id="38020402">After all this time, it's not so intolerable.</text>
<text id="38020403">I've actually become quite fond of it!</text>
<text id="38020404">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="38030000">Mmm...</text>
<text id="38030001">Mmm...</text>
<text id="38030100">Mmm...mmm...</text>
<text id="38030101">Mm! Oh-hoh!</text>
<text id="38030102">Forgive me. I was absorbed in thought.</text>
<text id="38030103">I am Siegmeyer of Catarina.</text>
<text id="38030104">Quite honestly, I have run up against a wall.</text>
<text id="38030105">Perhaps you've noticed those bug-eyed lizards?</text>
<text id="38030106">I've had a go at them, but their breath is petrifying.</text>
<text id="38030107">And so here I am, just thinking things over!</text>
<text id="38030108">Any moment now, and I'll be hit by an epiphany!</text>
<text id="38030109">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="38030200">Mmm...mmm...</text>
<text id="38030201">Mm! Oh-hoh!</text>
<text id="38030202">Forgive me. I was absorbed in thought.</text>
<text id="38030203">Perhaps you've noticed those bug-eyed lizards?</text>

<text id="38030205">And so here I am, just thinking things over!</text>
<text id="38030206">Any moment now, and I'll be hit by an epiphany!</text>
<text id="38030207">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="38030300">What about you? Any ideas?</text>
<text id="38030301">Ahh, I thought not. This is a difficult one, even for me...</text>
<text id="38030302">Hmm...quite a fix indeed...</text>
<text id="38030303">Perhaps I should aim for their eyes...</text>
<text id="38030400">Mmm...mmm...</text>
<text id="38030401">Mm! Oh-hoh!</text>
<text id="38030402">What's on your mind, friend?</text>
<text id="38030403">Wait!...Did you defeat those lizards?</text>
<text id="38030404">Ahh, you went for the eyes! I knew it...</text>
<text id="38030405">I am saved. This knight of Catarina thanks you sincerely.</text>
<text id="38030406">Please take this, as a token of my gratitude.</text>
<text id="38030407">But be warned, gallantry entails great risks.</text>
<text id="38030408">Next time, give me a chance to come up with a plan.</text>
<text id="38040000">Sng...sng...</text>
<text id="38040001">Zzzzzz...</text>
<text id="38040100">Sng...sng...</text>
<text id="38040101">Mm! Oh-hoh!</text>
<text id="38040102">Excuse me. I was so absorbed in thought, I just drifted away.</text>
<text id="38040103">You see, I'm actually in a bit of a fix.</text>
<text id="38040104">I've made it this far, but I'm short on antitode moss for the
trip back.</text>
<text id="38040105">...</text>
<text id="38040106">By my knighthood, I am ashamed to ask...</text>
<text id="38040107">But can you spare a few scraps of moss?</text>
<text id="38040120">Fantastic!</text>
<text id="38040121">Thank you, a saint you are.</text>
<text id="38040122">This knight of Catarina expresses his deepest gratitude. I shall
not forget this.</text>
<text id="38040123">Please, take this; a symbol of my appreciation.</text>
<text id="38040124">Well, our fates do seem entwined, don't they?</text>
<text id="38040125">Perhaps this, too, is the will of Lord Gwyn!</text>
<text id="38040126">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="38040140">Yes, I see...</text>
<text id="38040141">No need to worry!</text>
<text id="38040142">I'll be fine. I can make it without that silly moss.</text>
<text id="38040143">Think about it. Have I ever let a little hardship slow me down?</text>
<text id="38040144">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="38040200">The Poison Swamp...</text>
<text id="38040201">It's like quicksand in there...</text>
<text id="38040202">Mmm...</text>
<text id="38040300">Mmm...</text>
<text id="38040301">Mm! Oh-hoh!</text>
<text id="38040302">What's on your mind, friend?</text>
<text id="38040303">You've brought moss, perchance?</text>
<text id="38060000">Sng...sng...</text>
<text id="38060001">Zzzzzz...</text>
<text id="38060100">Sng...sng...</text>
<text id="38060101">Mm! Oh-hoh!</text>
<text id="38060102">Excuse me. I was so absorbed in thought, I just drifted away.</text>
<text id="38060103">It must be the warmth. Well, what's on your mind?</text>
<text id="38060104">No, don't tell me. Those monsters making life difficult for you?</text>
<text id="38060105">You need not be ashamed. We are in the same boat.</text>
<text id="38060106">...You know, I really have run up quite a debt to you.</text>
<text id="38060107">...Perhaps the time has come...</text>
<text id="38060108">...</text>
<text id="38060200">...</text>
<text id="38060201">Friend, I have an idea. A good one, really.</text>
<text id="38060202">...I will rush those dire fiends, and you can slip away in the
confusion.</text>
<text id="38060203">Please, friend, I owe you much more than this.</text>
<text id="38060204">By the honour of the knights of Catarina, allow me to assist you.</text>
<text id="38060205">And now, I go! Don't be slow!</text>
<text id="38060220">Hrgrraaaaggh!</text>
<text id="38060221">Hiyaaaaaah!</text>
<text id="38060222">C'mon! Over here, you fiends!</text>
<text id="38060223">Perish, foul creatures!</text>
<text id="38060224">I am Siegmeyer of Catarina, and you shall feel my wrath!</text>
<text id="38060300">...</text>
<text id="38060301">Oh, there you are.</text>
<text id="38060302">Wait!...Did you defeat those dire creatures?</text>
<text id="38060303">Outstanding...You never fail to impress.</text>
<text id="38060304">Well, wonderful. This knight of Catarina thanks you.</text>
<text id="38060305">Take this, as a token of my gratitude.</text>
<text id="38060306">I feel like I'm always thanking you...</text>
<text id="38060307">I curse my own inability.</text>
<text id="38060400">Hng...hng...</text>
<text id="38060401">Why, you! Didn't you get away?</text>
<text id="38060402">Well, you've saved me, once again...</text>
<text id="38060403">Dear me, what can I say? I have failed you...</text>
<text id="38060404">Hrgph...Aggkt...</text>
<text id="38060405">My dear little Lin...</text>
<text id="38060500">Hng...hng...</text>
<text id="38060501">But, you! Didn't you get away?</text>
<text id="38060502">Well, you've saved me, once again...</text>
<text id="38060503">Thank goodness...I'm exhausted...</text>
<text id="38060504">I think I'll have a rest.</text>
<text id="38060505">Don't you worry, the ground below me is my pillow.</text>
<text id="38060506">I'll recover shortly...</text>
<text id="38070000">Well! Fancy meeting you here.</text>
<text id="38070001">You did much for me up above. I am grateful.</text>
<text id="38070002">You know, I was thinking...</text>
<text id="38070003">The gates at the old fortress...</text>
<text id="38070004">Was that your doing?</text>
<text id="38070020">Yes! I knew it!</text>
<text id="38070021">It seemed like an unlikely coincidence.</text>
<text id="38070022">Well, am I fortunate! This knight of Catarina thanks you
sincerely.</text>
<text id="38070023">Please take this, as a token of my gratitude.</text>
<text id="38070040">Is that so?</text>
<text id="38070041">Hmm, no matter. Stranger things have happened.</text>
<text id="38070042">Sometimes one only has to give it some time.</text>
<text id="38070100">There you are.</text>
<text id="38070101">I'll be heading down below shortly.</text>
<text id="38070102">There's nothing worthwhile up above.</text>
<text id="38070103">No worries! Adventuring is my life; I'm prepared for the worst.</text>
<text id="38070104">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="38070200">Hello, friend. Still holding up?</text>
<text id="38070201">I owe you much. I was hoping that you would come.</text>
<text id="38070202">So that I could say thank you, for saving me. From one brave
knight to another.</text>
<text id="38070203">Please, take this, as a token of my gratitude.</text>
<text id="38070204">This is a relief. Now I have no regrets.</text>
<text id="38070205">I shall depart for my final adventure...</text>
<text id="38070300">Oh, hello, friend.</text>
<text id="38070301">I am preparing for my final adventure.</text>
<text id="38070302">Wherever you go, may you be safe.</text>
<text id="38070303">You are a true hero, to be sure.</text>
<text id="38070400">Oh, hello, friend.</text>
<text id="38070401">...My daughter risked life and limb, just to find me...</text>
<text id="38070402">...to deliver her mother's last words...And the poor girl's not
even Undead!</text>
<text id="38070403">Sigh...</text>
<text id="38070404">Heavens, I never asked her to do that...</text>
<text id="39000000">It was you who rescued me? Why, thank you.</text>
<text id="39000001">I am Sieglinde of Catarina.</text>
<text id="39000002">I don't know how I ended up in that crystal...</text>
<text id="39000003">It wasn't terrible in there, but I could hardly move.</text>
<text id="39000004">I must think of some way to repay you.</text>
<text id="39000100">Oh! Have you seen my father?</text>
<text id="39000101">You wouldn't miss him. A suit of armour, just like mine?</text>
<text id="39000120">Thank goodness! I knew he was here somewhere.</text>
<text id="39000121">Well then, now I must find him. Thanks again, truly.</text>
<text id="39000122">Now if he'll just stay put, and keep out of trouble.</text>
<text id="39000140">Yes, I see...But if you should happen to bump into him,</text>
<text id="39000141">tell him that Sieglinde is on her way, and that he ought to just
stay put.</text>
<text id="39000142">And again, thank you kindly.</text>
<text id="39000230">What in the...!</text>
<text id="39000240">What the devil?!</text>
<text id="39000300">Yes, now I see.</text>
<text id="39000301">You are one of the bad ones.</text>
<text id="39000302">Then, there's only one thing to do with you.</text>
<text id="39000400">Oh, how can this be...!</text>
<text id="39000401">...dear Father...</text>
<text id="39000500">Rest assured. I will kill you as many times as it takes.</text>
<text id="39020000">Oh, hello again.</text>
<text id="39020001">We're both managing quite well, aren't we?</text>
<text id="39020002">But I haven't found my father yet. Have you seen him?</text>
<text id="39020003">Really! Then I must be off.</text>
<text id="39020004">I'm sorry he's caused you trouble...He has a knack for that. If
he'd just stay put...</text>
<text id="39020005">Yes, I see. Well, I had to ask.</text>
<text id="39020006">I will continue searching a bit longer. Thank you so much.</text>
<text id="39020100">Well, hello again!</text>
<text id="39020101">I have finally located my father.</text>
<text id="39020102">All of your help was invaluable to us...Thank you so much.</text>
<text id="39020103">I was finally able to pass on my mother's last words.</text>
<text id="39020200">My father? He went on his final adventure.</text>
<text id="39020201">Don't worry, that's just the way he is. Undead or no. Sort of
reassuring, really.</text>
<text id="39020202">If he goes Hollow, I'll just have to kill him again.</text>
<text id="39030000">My father...all Hollow now...has been subdued. He will cause no
more trouble.</text>
<text id="39030001">It's finally over...I will return to Catarina.</text>
<text id="39030002">You assisted us both greatly. I can hardly return the favour,</text>
<text id="39030003">but please accept this. It's of no use to me now.</text>
<text id="39030100">Oh, father...dear father...</text>
<text id="39030101">Sob...</text>
<text id="40000000">Oh? Still human, are you?</text>
<text id="40000001">Then I am in luck. Could you help me?</text>
<text id="40000002">As you can see I am stuck, without recourse.</text>
<text id="40000020">I entreat you. Have pity on this powerless knight.</text>
<text id="40000021">Surely you can imagine the depth of such dejection?</text>
<text id="40000040">Please, I have duties to fulfil, and I will reward you
handsomely.</text>
<text id="40000041">Well? I am certain you stand to benefit.</text>
<text id="40000060">Why! You!</text>
<text id="40000061">Do not run away! Hear me out!</text>
<text id="40000080">Ahh, you have come back.</text>
<text id="40000081">I beg of you. Help me.</text>
<text id="40000100">Thank you, yes, sincerely.</text>
<text id="40000101">I am Knight Lautrec of Carim.</text>
<text id="40000102">I truly appreciate this, and I guarantee a reward, only later.</text>
<text id="40000200">Yes, very sorry, your reward will have to wait.</text>
<text id="40000201">I have just been freed. Allow me some time.</text>
<text id="40000220">I am free. Now I can get back to work...</text>
<text id="40000221">Keh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="40000340">Well, what have we here?</text>
<text id="40000360">Keh keh keh. Are you sure about this?</text>
<text id="40000400">You leave me no choice.</text>
<text id="40000401">I was once grateful to you,</text>
<text id="40000402">But if this is our fate, so be it!</text>
<text id="40000500">You despicable...</text>
<text id="40000501">...Curses...How could I...</text>
<text id="40010000">Ahh, hello there.</text>
<text id="40010001">I have your reward. Please accept it.</text>
<text id="40010002">I am grateful to you. For freeing me...</text>
<text id="40010003">Keh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="40010004">...Not enough for you? Well, let's not be greedy, now...</text>
<text id="40010005">Keh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="40010020">By the Lords...Your face...</text>
<text id="40010021">By the Lords...Your voice...</text>
<text id="40010022">Hmmm... Your humanity is really slipping.</text>
<text id="40010023">But there are methods. Most fools have more humanity than they
know what to do with.</text>
<text id="40010024">Now, who do you imagine will make the best use of it, hmm?</text>
<text id="40010080">Well, where have you been?</text>
<text id="40010081">I am glad to see you are safe.</text>
<text id="40010100">Hm, you again? What is it?</text>
<text id="40010102">Our futures are murky. Let's not be too friendly, now.</text>
<text id="40010120">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="40010121">I'm considering a change of location...</text>
<text id="40010122">I have a rather, pressing matter to attend to up above.</text>
<text id="40010123">That Keeper has served me well, but...enough with her...</text>
<text id="40010124">Keh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="40010140">...You...</text>
<text id="40010141">How dare you come prancing about!</text>
<text id="40010142">I have nothing to say. Be gone from my sight.</text>
<text id="40010160">Hello...I don't think we've met.</text>
<text id="40010161">I am Knight Lautrec of Carim.</text>
<text id="40010162">We are both Undead. Perhaps we can help one another.</text>
<text id="40010163">Keh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="40010180">Hmm, what business do you have?</text>
<text id="40010181">If you have none, then stay silent.</text>
<text id="40010200">Ahh, you certainly are keeping busy.</text>
<text id="40010201">Care to pay for a useful tip?</text>
<text id="40010220">A wise choice, indeed.</text>
<text id="40010221">Maiden Thorolund and her followers recently arrived in this land,</text>
<text id="40010222">but she became stranded deep below the Catacombs.</text>
<text id="40010223">Her followers either fled, or were reduced to Hollows...Leaving
Maiden Thorolund all alone.</text>
<text id="40010224">Not a bad tip, huh? A nubile cleric would be replete with
humanity...</text>
<text id="40010240">Oh, really?</text>
<text id="40010241">Well, suit yourself. Only trying to help.</text>
<text id="40010260">Hm? That tip I gave you?</text>
<text id="40010261">Ahh, I heard it from a fleeing old man.</text>
<text id="40010262">That poor bastard! All his robes and trinkets won't help him now!</text>
<text id="40010263">Kwah hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="40020000">Why, you...How far will you come?!</text>
<text id="40020001">...Please, leave me alone...</text>
<text id="40020002">What have I done to you?</text>
<text id="40020003">...Please, I beg of you...</text>
<text id="40020100">Tsk!</text>
<text id="40020101">You won't let me be?</text>
<text id="40020102">Then I have no choice! You will regret this!</text>
<text id="40020103">How dare you insult Lautrec the Embraced!</text>
<text id="40020104">May the Goddess have Mercy upon you.</text>
<text id="40020200">Well! You again?</text>
<text id="40020201">Well, look at you.</text>
<text id="40020202">I thought you were wiser, but I thought wrong!</text>
<text id="40020203">Tis a terrible pity. Like a moth flittering towards a flame.</text>
<text id="40020204">You fellows? No? Don't you agree?</text>
<text id="40020300">So, here we go again!</text>
<text id="40020301">Oh, look, another one!</text>
<text id="40020302">How many times will these lambs rush to slaughter?</text>
<text id="40020303">Well, let's get it over with.</text>
<text id="40020400">Have you heard of Trusty Patches?</text>
<text id="40020401">If ever a man has rubbed me up the wrong way, ugh!</text>
<text id="40020402">If he ever comes around again, I swear, I'll have his hide.</text>
<text id="41000000">I've heard all about you.</text>
<text id="41000001">I'm Shiva of the East, captain of the brigade.</text>
<text id="41000002">Let's teach you the clan basics now,</text>
<text id="41000003">as there is no time to chat in the midst of fighting.</text>
<text id="41000004">Except there's little in the form of rules, you hear?</text>
<text id="41000005">Fight and hunt as you like. Whoever's fastest gets the prey.
That's the way we do it.</text>
<text id="41000006">Only...Don't forget what Alvina said. Traitors aren't given a
second chance, for any reason.</text>
<text id="41000007">That's about it, then.</text>
<text id="41000008">Don't worry, it's a good old time, isn't it?</text>
<text id="41000009">Great to have you with us. Good hunting to you.</text>
<text id="41000100">Ah, did you notice that one? Sharp eyes!</text>
<text id="41000101">He's one of the clan. From the East, like myself.</text>
<text id="41000102">Always slinking in the shadows, but he's a tough one.</text>
<text id="41000103">You'll see what I mean.</text>
<text id="41000104">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="41000200">Don't worry, now.</text>
<text id="41000201">You'll be called in soon enough.</text>
<text id="41000202">Hunters with patience score the best kills.</text>
<text id="41000300">Hrg!</text>
<text id="41000310">Mnph!</text>
<text id="41000320">Why, you dirty...!</text>
<text id="41000330">Have you lost it?</text>
<text id="41000400">Turning on us from the very start?</text>
<text id="41000401">You have some guts, to turn on us!</text>
<text id="41000402">Have a look at my sword, for it's the last thing you'll see!</text>
<text id="41000500">Hiyaah!</text>
<text id="41000501">Haaah!</text>
<text id="41000502">Hiiyah!</text>
<text id="41000600">You poor fool...</text>
<text id="41000601">You won't be able to run far enough...</text>
<text id="41000700">You sick Hollow...</text>
<text id="41000701">Don't you ever come round again.</text>
<text id="41010000">Hello again.</text>
<text id="41010001">Strange to meet away from the clan and the forest.</text>
<text id="41010002">But while you're here, how about some equipment?</text>
<text id="41010003">I love collecting these things, but I can only keep so many.</text>
<text id="41010004">And, you know, you are a friend. I'll sell them cheap.</text>
<text id="41010100">We meet again.</text>
<text id="41010101">I have the equipment, if you have the need.</text>
<text id="41010200">Well, there you are again.</text>
<text id="41010201">I've culled my best picks from my last summoning.</text>
<text id="41010202">Have a look, will you?</text>
<text id="41010300">I see you have a sharp eye for trinkets.</text>
<text id="41010301">Suits me fine. I'll be seeing you.</text>
<text id="41010400">Right then. I'll see you in the forest.</text>
<text id="41010500">Right then. I'll be seeing you.</text>
<text id="41010600">Have you heard of Chaos Blade?</text>
<text id="41010601">The legendary sword of the ancient Undead master Makoto, its
blade a swirling vortex.</text>
<text id="41010602">I heard it's somewhere around here, but I can't find it.</text>
<text id="41010603">...It's all I could ever wish for...</text>
<text id="41010604">...I'd do anything to have it...</text>
<text id="41010700">Why, look at you!</text>
<text id="41010701">Just wait will you!</text>
<text id="41010702">Your sword! Is it not... the Chaos Blade...?</text>
<text id="41010703">I've been searching for her for ages!</text>
<text id="41010704">...I beg of you, and I promise repay you...Will you give the
sword to me?</text>
<text id="41010800">Excellent! Much gratitude!</text>
<text id="41010801">As promised, this is for you. Go ahead, take it.</text>
<text id="41010802">Ahh, splendid, the Chaos Blade...Look into the
vortex...Wonderful...</text>
<text id="41010803">Simply wonderful...</text>
<text id="41010804">Oh my, oh my...</text>
<text id="41010805">But the sword's true value...hmm...</text>
<text id="41010806">Can't be known without a good killing...</text>
<text id="41010900">...Yes, quite alright, I cannot blame you.</text>
<text id="41010901">The blade is yours, after all.</text>
<text id="41010902">...So, I will do the honourable thing...</text>
<text id="41010903">...And kill you for it...</text>
<text id="41011000">Don't you run away! Be still you rat!</text>
<text id="41011001">Taste my blade, taste it, you devil!</text>
<text id="41011002">Hee hee!</text>
<text id="41011003">Hee, hee hee hee!</text>
<text id="41011100">This is what you get for crossing me.</text>
<text id="41011101">Have a look at my sword, for it's the last thing you'll see!</text>
<text id="41011200">Red...the colour of blood...</text>
<text id="41011201">Hee hee...hee...</text>
<text id="41011300">By the devils...</text>
<text id="41011301">You won't be able to run far enough...</text>
<text id="41011400">What a wonderful specimen...Like slicing through butter...</text>
<text id="41011401">Hee, hee, nee hee hee!</text>
<text id="41011500">Your ambitions have sealed your fate.</text>
<text id="41011501">But, who'd have thought I'd be the traitor?</text>
<text id="41011502">Sometimes you never know, do you...</text>
<text id="41011503">Keh heh heh heh!</text>
<text id="42000000">Good day! You look reasonably sane!</text>
<text id="42000001">What are you doing in the Catacombs? Are you a cleric or
something?</text>
<text id="42000020">Yes, I imagined as much.</text>
<text id="42000021">Best of luck with your pilgrimages or missions or whatever you
do.</text>
<text id="42000022">This place is treacherous. Do watch your step, eh?</text>
<text id="42000023">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42000040">No? Well, that's strange.</text>
<text id="42000041">Ohhh, I know what it is. You've come for the trinkets, haven't
you?</text>
<text id="42000042">Well, whatever it is...</text>
<text id="42000043">This place is treacherous. Do watch your step.</text>
<text id="42000044">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42000100">Yeah? What is it now?</text>
<text id="42000101">Enough with the chit-chat. In a place like this, we need to stay
on our toes.</text>
<text id="42000200">Ah, oh! Well, well, how are you, then?</text>
<text id="42000201">I, uh, sort of lost my way, yes...</text>
<text id="42000202">But when I came here, I didn't touch any levers, no, not me!</text>
<text id="42000203">Very peculiar, isn't it? Wait, did something happen to you?</text>
<text id="42000204">Hey, don't look at me like that. I'm Trusty Patches, the
one-and-only!</text>
<text id="42000205">Here, everything's good with us, eh? Aww, c'mon, take it!</text>
<text id="42000206">Heh heh. We'll be wonderful friends.</text>
<text id="42000207">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42000300">Oh, does it really matter that much?</text>
<text id="42000301">C'mon, now. What exactly do you think I did?</text>
<text id="42000302">You're not making sense, my friend.</text>
<text id="42000303">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42000400">Ah, oh! Well, how are you, then?</text>
<text id="42000401">...I slipped and flipped that lever, you see...</text>
<text id="42000402">...It didn't cause you any trouble, by chance?</text>
<text id="42000500">Are you certain?!</text>
<text id="42000501">Well, that's a fine shame. Oh, I'm truly sorry, really!</text>
<text id="42000502">But, wait now, you didn't actually fall down, then?</text>
<text id="42000503">Well, why didn't you tell me sooner! All's well that ends well!</text>
<text id="42000504">Everybody makes mistakes. I'm not above it all, I swear!</text>
<text id="42000505">I'm Trusty Patches, the one-and-only!</text>
<text id="42000506">I know! This should make up for it.</text>
<text id="42000507">We're on the same side! Undead outcasts!</text>
<text id="42000508">Fantastic, isn't it?</text>
<text id="42000509">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42000600">Oh, really? Yes, I see...Righty-oh!</text>
<text id="42000601">Then, everything's good, isn't it?</text>
<text id="42000602">I'm Trusty Patches, the one-and-only!</text>
<text id="42000603">You and I, just a couple of Undead outcasts, right mate?</text>
<text id="42000604">You and I, just a couple of Undead outcasts, right my darling?</text>
<text id="42000605">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42000700">Oh, will you come off it, now!</text>
<text id="42000701">You're fine and well, so what's the difference!</text>
<text id="42000702">Nobody likes a crybaby, you know?</text>
<text id="42000703">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42000840">Oww!</text>
<text id="42000850">What the devil!</text>
<text id="42000860">Please, no!</text>
<text id="42000900">All right, all right, if that's the way it is!</text>
<text id="42000901">You silly little bastard!</text>
<text id="42000902">You impossible little wench!</text>
<text id="42000903">Well, I've had enough of you!</text>
<text id="42000904">Take your higher cause and stuff it, you lousy charlatan!</text>
<text id="42000905">You lousy good-for-nothing! Wallow in your spit!</text>
<text id="42000906">You filthy wench! You'll get what you deserve!</text>
<text id="42001000">Curses...I'm finished...</text>
<text id="42001001">What did I ever...</text>
<text id="42001100">Phew...The righteous prevail, again...</text>
<text id="42001101">Hey, don't blame me, mate.</text>
<text id="42001102">Hey, don't blame me, me old darling.</text>
<text id="42001240">What?! Oww!</text>
<text id="42001250">Oi! Put an end to that!</text>
<text id="42001260">Stop that!</text>
<text id="42001300">Curses, what's wrong with you!</text>
<text id="42001301">Well, if that's what it has to be! Why you...</text>
<text id="42001400">Curses! How in the...</text>
<text id="42001401">What did I do? What...did...I...do?!</text>
<text id="42001500">What happened to you?</text>
<text id="42001501">Curses, you left me no choice...</text>
<text id="42010000">Good day! You look reasonably sane!</text>
<text id="42010001">What are you doing in the Catacombs? Are you a cleric or
something?</text>
<text id="42010100">Yes, I guessed as much.</text>
<text id="42010101">Well, here's a tip.</text>
<text id="42010102">There's a stash of treasure right down that hole.</text>
<text id="42010103">I found it first, but...well, you're the cleric, right?</text>
<text id="42010104">I owe you for all that, er, praying and what not...I'll give you
first pick.</text>
<text id="42010105">Well, go on, have a look. It'll shimmer you blind.</text>
<text id="42010106">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42010200">No? Really?</text>
<text id="42010201">Then I'd have no qualms telling you,</text>
<text id="42010202">there's a fine stash of treasure right down that hole.</text>
<text id="42010203">I found it first, but...well, we're friends now, so I'll split it
with you!</text>
<text id="42010204">In any case, have a look, it'll shimmer you blind!</text>
<text id="42010205">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42010300">What, you again? Well, well!</text>
<text id="42010301">Where have you been? Any tidings, hmm?</text>
<text id="42010302">Oh, you came at the perfect time.</text>
<text id="42010303">There's a fine stash of treasure right down that hole.</text>
<text id="42010304">I found it first, but...well, you're the cleric, right?</text>
<text id="42010305">I owe you for all that... praying and what not...look I'll give
you first pick.</text>
<text id="42010306">Well, go on, have a look. It'll shimmer you blind.</text>
<text id="42010307">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42010400">What, you again? Well, well!</text>
<text id="42010401">You've been a stranger. Ah, good to see you're well, mate.</text>
<text id="42010402">You've been a stranger. Ah it's good to see you're well, my
darling.</text>
<text id="42010403">Oh right, you came at the perfect time.</text>
<text id="42010404">There's a fine stash of treasure right down that hole.</text>
<text id="42010405">I found it first, but...well, we're friends now. I'll split it
with you!</text>
<text id="42010406">In any case, have a look, it'll shimmer you blind!</text>
<text id="42010407">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42010500">There, that hole. Take a closer look.</text>
<text id="42010600">What's your problem?</text>
<text id="42010601">Take a peep in the hole, and check out that treasure!</text>
<text id="42010700">Heh heh, you got what you deserve!</text>
<text id="42010701">You damn clerics, you're worse than maggots!</text>
<text id="42010702">You must be loaded! I'll strip your corpse clean!</text>
<text id="42010703">Nyah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="42010800">Heh heh, this is what I do, my friend.</text>
<text id="42010801">The trinkets I'll be stripping off your corpse; that's the real
treasure!</text>
<text id="42010802">Nyah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="42010900">...Oh, you, I...</text>
<text id="42010901">Well, let's just calm down. Talk about things...</text>
<text id="42010902">I did you wrong. But, I didn't mean it.</text>
<text id="42010903">These...temptations, they can, well, overcome me...</text>
<text id="42010904">You know what I mean? Don't you? Please forgive me.</text>
<text id="42010905">You and me, we're jolly Undead outcasts, aren't we?</text>
<text id="42011000">Oh, brilliant! A second chance! Wonderful!</text>
<text id="42011001">I had a feeling you'd understand, I did.</text>
<text id="42011002">But if I were in your shoes...Ooh! Who knows what I'd have done?
But now...We're friends again, eh?</text>
<text id="42011003">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42011100">Oh, for heaven's sake, let's not mope about, eh?</text>
<text id="42011101">You're still alive, I've said I'm sorry!</text>
<text id="42011102">Wait, I know! Here, take this. It proves something, doesn't it?</text>
<text id="42011103">We're both Undead outcasts, what could be better?</text>
<text id="42011104">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42011200">Blimey, how did you...</text>
<text id="42011201">You weren't supposed to survive that...</text>
<text id="42011202">Well, no matter. I'll settle this once and for all.</text>
<text id="42011203">You lousy self-righteous cleric!</text>
<text id="42011300">I did you wrong. But, I didn't mean it.</text>
<text id="42011301">These...temptations, they can overcome me...</text>
<text id="42011302">You know what I mean? Don't you? Please, forgive me.</text>
<text id="42020000">Oh, we meet again. How many of you are there?</text>
<text id="42020001">You've come at the perfect time.</text>
<text id="42020002">I'm done with the looting. I'm a humble merchant now!</text>
<text id="42020003">And wondrous treasures, have I! At a special price for you.</text>
<text id="42020004">There you are, have a nice look at them.</text>
<text id="42020005">Oh relax, no more funny business out of me, my friend!</text>
<text id="42020100">Oh, you again. Fancy that.</text>
<text id="42020101">You've come at the perfect time.</text>
<text id="42020102">Some new gems have come my way.</text>
<text id="42020103">I saved them specially, just for you, mate.</text>
<text id="42020104">I saved them specially, just for you, my darling.</text>
<text id="42020200">Oh, there you are again.</text>
<text id="42020201">Welcome to Trusty Patches' Trove of Treasures.</text>
<text id="42020202">We chop prices, not limbs!</text>
<text id="42020300">What, nothing appeals to you?</text>
<text id="42020301">Well, you must have poor taste.</text>
<text id="42020400">Come on, you can do better than that.</text>
<text id="42020401">Nobody likes a tightwad, you hear me?</text>
<text id="42020500">Right? Good stuff, eh?</text>
<text id="42020501">Don't you forget who got it for you!</text>
<text id="42020502">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="42020600">How is it? Fine stuff, eh?</text>
<text id="42020601">Don't forget to thank me.</text>
<text id="42020700">Oi, have you met Lautrec the Embraced?</text>
<text id="42020701">Believe me on this one, bruv...He's completely mad.</text>
<text id="42020702">Believe me on this one, my love...He's completely mad.</text>
<text id="42020703">He wouldn't think twice about cutting somebody down.</text>
<text id="42020704">So watch out for him, especially if you've humanity to spare.</text>
<text id="42020800">Oi, have you met Petrus, that self-proclaimed cleric?</text>
<text id="42020801">Believe me on this one, bruv...The man is scum.</text>
<text id="42020802">Believe me on this one, my love...The man is scum.</text>
<text id="42020803">Don't you be fooled by his claims to do good.</text>
<text id="42020804">They're all the same, those rotten clerics.</text>
<text id="42020900">Here, have you met that sunbathing Solaire?</text>
<text id="42020901">Believe me on this one, bruv...He's a complete idiot.</text>
<text id="42020902">Believe me on this one, my love...He's a complete idiot.</text>
<text id="42020903">But he happens to be an awfully strong idiot.</text>
<text id="42020904">Just nod your head, and keep him on your side!</text>
<text id="42020905">Nyah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="42021000">Here, have you met that backwoods Shiva?</text>
<text id="42021001">Believe me on this one, bruv...The man is trouble.</text>
<text id="42021002">Believe me on this one, my love...The man is trouble.</text>
<text id="42021003">I can see it in his eyes. I just can.</text>
<text id="42021004">Hmph, No doubt about it. Watch him.</text>
<text id="43000000">Hmgg...Hmgg...</text>
<text id="43000100">Ahh, hello. Was it you who rang the Bell of Awakening?</text>
<text id="43000101">I am the primordial serpent, Kingseeker Frampt, close friend of
the Great Lord Gwyn.</text>
<text id="43000102">Chosen Undead, who has rung the Bell of Awakening.</text>
<text id="43000103">I wish to elucidate your fate,</text>
<text id="43000104">and the very reason your kind have appeared.</text>
<text id="43000105">Do you seek such enlightenment?</text>
<text id="43000120">Very well. Then I am pleased to share.</text>
<text id="43000121">Chosen Undead. Your fate...is to succeed the Great Lord Gwyn.</text>
<text id="43000122">So that you may link the Fire, cast away the Dark, and undo the
curse of the Undead.</text>
<text id="43000123">To this end, you must visit Anor Londo, and acquire the
Lordvessel.</text>
<text id="43000124">Now that you are ready,</text>
<text id="43000125">I shall open Sen's Fortress, which leads to Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="43000126">Hraaaoogggh!</text>
<text id="43000127">Hraaaoogggh!</text>
<text id="43000128">The arduous path of honour is open. Go forth, and seize your
Undead destiny.</text>
<text id="43000140">By the Lords...Are you certain?</text>
<text id="43000141">Well, perhaps I was wrong.</text>
<text id="43000142">There can be only one chosen Undead. I will continue my
search...You are freed from duty.</text>
<text id="43000143">But then again, you did ring the Bell of Awakening.</text>
<text id="43000144">I will stay here a while. Speak with me if you should change your
mind.</text>
<text id="43000200">Ahh, one other thing.</text>
<text id="43000201">You will require humanity to remain yourself while Undead.</text>
<text id="43000202">This I can provide you,</text>
<text id="43000203">but only in trade for souls.</text>
<text id="43000300">I am pleased to see you well.</text>
<text id="43000301">Is it something urgent?</text>
<text id="43000400">Hmgg...Hmgg...</text>
<text id="43000500">...Hm? No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.</text>
<text id="43000501">Well and wide awake!</text>
<text id="43000502">Do not treat me like an old withering snake.</text>
<text id="43000600">What brings you here?</text>
<text id="43000601">By the Lords, you may as well be a Hollow.</text>
<text id="43000602">This will not do. Your humanity requires replenishment.</text>
<text id="43000700">What brings you here?</text>
<text id="43000701">Had a change of heart about your fate as an Undead?</text>
<text id="43000800">Those who seek the Realm of Lords must brave Sen's Fortress, a
deadly house of traps.</text>
<text id="43000801">Many have gone before you, but none have returned.</text>
<text id="43000802">Fate has chosen you, but proceed with caution.</text>
<text id="43000900">Farewell.</text>
<text id="43000901">Chosen Undead. I remain here, and await thee.</text>
<text id="43001000">Heavens! You have done it! You have retrieved the Lordvessel!</text>
<text id="43001001">After a thousand years! It is you, it is really you!</text>
<text id="43001002">Hraaaoogggh!</text>
<text id="43001003">Hraaaoogggh!</text>
<text id="43001004">...</text>
<text id="43001005">Forgive me. I really should calm down.</text>
<text id="43001006">Now, let us take that vessel on a journey.</text>
<text id="43001007">I assume that you are ready. Now, be still!</text>
<text id="43001008">This is the Firelink Chamber, for the successor of Lord Gwyn.</text>
<text id="43001009">Now, place the Lordvessel on the altar.</text>
<text id="43001100">What is it? Place the Lordvessel on the altar.</text>
<text id="43001101">No reason for pause at this point.</text>
<text id="43001200">Very well.</text>
<text id="43001201">As Kingseeker, I shall now instruct you, the Lord's successor, in
your next task.</text>
<text id="43001202">To achieve your fate, fill the vessel with powerful souls,</text>
<text id="43001203">commensurate to the great soul of Gwyn.</text>
<text id="43001204">Scarce few possess such brilliant souls.</text>
<text id="43001205">Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith,</text>
<text id="43001206">the Four Kings of New Londo, who inherited the shards of Gwyn's
soul...</text>
<text id="43001207">and Lord Gwyn's former confidant, Seath the Scaleless.</text>
<text id="43001208">All of their souls are required to satiate the Lordvessel.</text>
<text id="43001209">...</text>
<text id="43001210">Are you ready?</text>
<text id="43001211">Then we shall return. Stay still for a moment!</text>
<text id="43001300">The beings who possess these souls have outlived their
usefulness, or have chosen the path of the wicked.</text>
<text id="43001301">As the primordial serpent, I implore you to defeat them, and
claim their souls.</text>
<text id="43001302">Let there be no guilt; let there be no vacillation.</text>
<text id="43001400">Very well.</text>
<text id="43001401">Then, stay still for a moment!</text>
<text id="43001500">Are you ready?</text>
<text id="43001501">Then we shall return. Stay still, then!</text>
<text id="43001600">Ahh...ohh!</text>
<text id="43001601">The Lordvessel is satiated...</text>
<text id="43001602">Magnificent...You are the righteous successor to Gwyn, the new
Great Lord.</text>
<text id="43001603">And I am Kingseeker no more...</text>
<text id="43001604">Your acquaintance was an honour.</text>
<text id="43001605">I must admit, I am fond of you humans.</text>
<text id="43001606">May you enjoy serendipity,</text>
<text id="43001607">And may the Age of Fire perpetuate.</text>
<text id="43001700">Hmg!</text>
<text id="43001701">Hrg!</text>
<text id="43001702">Agh!</text>
<text id="43001703">Ooph!</text>
<text id="43001704">Cease.</text>
<text id="43001705">Enough.</text>
<text id="43001706">Infidel.</text>
<text id="43001707">You sorry fool...You could not be the Chosen one.</text>
<text id="43001708">Enough...I shall slumber, until I am awakened again...</text>
<text id="44000000">Greetings, Undead warrior.</text>
<text id="44000001">I am the primordial serpent Darkstalker Kaathe.</text>
<text id="44000002">I can guide thee, and illuminate the truth.</text>
<text id="44000003">Undead Warrior, conqueror of the Four Kings; is this not your
wish?</text>
<text id="44000004">To know the truth of men, and the Undead?</text>
<text id="44000100">A wise choice, Undead warrior.</text>
<text id="44000101">Prove you must, that the truth becomes you.</text>
<text id="44000102">Seek Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="44000103">And claim Gwyn's heirloom, the Lordvessel.</text>
<text id="44000104">I will open Sen's Fortress, which leads to Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="44000105">Hraaaoogggh!</text>
<text id="44000106">Hraaaoogggh!</text>
<text id="44000107">Now go, Undead warrior.</text>
<text id="44000108">Show the world that the truth becomes you.</text>
<text id="44000400">...</text>
<text id="44000401">...Very well.</text>
<text id="44000402">Warriors as yourself are few. I will be patient.</text>
<text id="44000403">But I cannot wait forever...</text>
<text id="44000500">Ahh...</text>
<text id="44000501">If you wish, I shall grant the art of Lifedrain,</text>
<text id="44000502">the legendary power of the Dark Lord.</text>
<text id="44000503">It can preserve your humanity while Undead,</text>
<text id="44000504">and cast off the shackles placed upon your brethren.</text>
<text id="44000600">What is it?</text>
<text id="44000601">I am your guardian.</text>
<text id="44000602">Go on, state your wish.</text>
<text id="44000700">What is it?</text>
<text id="44000701">Perhaps you have changed your mind?</text>
<text id="44000800">Farewell.</text>
<text id="44000900">Hmm...You are astonishing.</text>
<text id="44000901">The truth I shall share, without sentiment.</text>
<text id="44000902">After the advent of Fire, the ancient Lords found the three
souls. </text>
<text id="44000903">But your progenitor found a fourth, unique soul.</text>
<text id="44000904">The Dark Soul.</text>
<text id="44000905">Your ancestor claimed the Dark Soul, and waited for Fire to
subside.</text>
<text id="44000906">And soon, the flames did fade, and only Dark remained.</text>
<text id="44000907">Thus began the age of men, the Age of Dark.</text>
<text id="44000908">However...</text>
<text id="44000909">Lord Gwyn trembled at the Dark.</text>
<text id="44000910">Clinging to his Age of Fire, and in dire fear of humans,</text>
<text id="44000911">and the Dark Lord who would one day be born amongst them,</text>
<text id="44000912">Lord Gwyn resisted the course of nature.</text>
<text id="44000913">By sacrificing himself to link the Fire, and commanding his
children to shepherd the humans,</text>
<text id="44000914">Gwyn has blurred your past, to prevent the birth of the Dark
Lord.</text>
<text id="44000915">I am the primordial serpent.</text>
<text id="44000916">I seek to right the wrongs of the past, to discover our true
Lord.</text>
<text id="44000917">But the other serpent, Frampt, lost his sense, and befriended
Lord Gwyn.</text>
<text id="44000918">Undead Warrior, we stand at a crossroads.</text>
<text id="44000919">Only I know the truth about your fate.</text>
<text id="44000920">You must destroy the fading Lord Gwyn, who has coddled Fire and
resisted nature,</text>
<text id="44000921">and become the Fourth Lord, so that you may usher in an Age of
Dark!</text>
<text id="44001000">Very well!</text>
<text id="44001001">I shall now guide you to Gwyn's prison.</text>
<text id="44001002">Be still. Entrust thine flesh to me.</text>
<text id="44001003">This is Gwyn's prison.</text>
<text id="44001004">Now, place the Lordvessel upon the altar.</text>
<text id="44001100">What is it? Place the Lordvessel upon the altar.</text>
<text id="44001200">Very well.</text>
<text id="44001201">Once the vessel is filled with souls, the gate to Gwyn shall
open.</text>
<text id="44001202">Seek Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith, and the traitor Seath
the Scaleless.</text>
<text id="44001203">Fill this vessel with their souls.</text>
<text id="44001204">Then, the gate will open...so that you may kill Gwyn.</text>
<text id="44001205">...</text>
<text id="44001206">Are you ready?</text>
<text id="44001207">Then, let us return to the Abyss. Entrust thine flesh to me.</text>
<text id="44001300">Nonsense!</text>
<text id="44001301">Are you mad! This is deplorable!</text>
<text id="44001302">You would rather be a slave? Does the truth mean nothing to you?</text>
<text id="44001303">This is unacceptable! Impossible! Unthinkable!</text>
<text id="44001304">...</text>
<text id="44001305">...Oh, enough with you.</text>
<text id="44001306">Farewell, pitiful, unknowing fool.</text>
<text id="44001307">I shall return to the Abyss, and await the true Lord of Men.</text>
<text id="44001400">Very well.</text>
<text id="44001401">Be still. Entrust thy flesh to me.</text>
<text id="44001500">Are you ready?</text>
<text id="44001501">Then, let us return to the Abyss. Entrust thine flesh to me.</text>
<text id="44001600">Magnificent.</text>
<text id="44001601">You have followed my teachings faithfully.</text>
<text id="44001602">You are the true lord of men, the Dark Lord.</text>
<text id="44001603">Now, go forth, and rid us of that enfeebled Gwyn.</text>
<text id="44001604">I, Kaathe, shall await you here.</text>
<text id="44001605">When you return, I shall serve you, in the imminent Age of Dark.</text>
<text id="44001606">I shall serve you, in the imminent Age of Dark.</text>
<text id="44001700">My Lord, bless thy safe return.</text>
<text id="44001701">Let Kaathe, and Frampt, serve Your Highness.</text>
<text id="44001702">We are here to serve Your Highness.</text>
<text id="44001703">Let true Dark be cast upon the world.</text>
<text id="44001704">Our Lord hath returned'st...</text>
<text id="44001800">Undead warrior,</text>
<text id="44001801">To speak now is premature.</text>
<text id="44001802">It begins with your retrieval of the Lordvessel.</text>
<text id="44001900">They failed me, every last one of them.</text>
<text id="44001901">They were strong, but saw not the truth.</text>
<text id="44001902">...I am certain that you will prove different.</text>
<text id="44002000">Hmg!</text>
<text id="44002001">Hrg!</text>
<text id="44002002">Agh!</text>
<text id="44002003">Ooph!</text>
<text id="44002004">Stop!</text>
<text id="44002005">Enough!</text>
<text id="44002006">Fool!</text>
<text id="44002007">Fool...You could not be the Dark Lord.</text>
<text id="44002008">Enough of this...and farewell to you.</text>
<text id="44002009">I shall return to the Abyss, and await the true Lord of Men.</text>
<text id="46000000">Who art thou?</text>
<text id="46000001">One of us, thou art not.</text>
<text id="46000002">If thou hast misstepped into this world,</text>
<text id="46000003">plunge down from the plank, and hurry home.</text>
<text id="46000004">If thou seekest I,</text>
<text id="46000005">thine desires shall be requited not.</text>
<text id="46000100">Thou must returneth whence thou came.</text>
<text id="46000101">This land is peaceful, its inhabitants kind, but thou dost not
belong.</text>
<text id="46000102">I beg of thee, plunge down from the plank, and hurry home.</text>
<text id="46000200">I expected as much from thee.</text>
<text id="46000201">Why dost thee hurry toward thine death?</text>
<text id="46000300">Ahh...</text>
<text id="46000301">But, why...What seeketh thee?</text>
<text id="46000400">Why could thou not let us be?</text>
<text id="46000401">Didst thou not see why Ariamis created this world?</text>
<text id="47000000">Greetings.</text>
<text id="47000001">I am Oswald of Carim, the Pardoner.</text>
<text id="47000020">Thou art a friend. For thee, a warm welcome.</text>
<text id="47000021">If thou desireth to preserve thy humanity, then confess thy
misdoings to me.</text>
<text id="47000022">Be it granting absolution, or doling penance; all sin is my
domain.</text>
<text id="47000040">Thou appearest to lack faith, but the Gods are magnanimous.</text>
<text id="47000041">If thou desireth to preserve thy humanity, then confess thy
misdoings to me.</text>
<text id="47000042">Be it granting absolution, or doling penance; all sin is my
domain.</text>
<text id="47000100">Greetings, and welcome back.</text>
<text id="47000101">I am pleased to see thee preserving thine humanity.</text>
<text id="47000200">Greetings, and a pleasure to see thee again.</text>
<text id="47000201">Art thou in need of mine assistance? Do not be bashful.</text>
<text id="47000300">Greetings. Just in time, art thee not?</text>
<text id="47000301">Thou art safe now. Quickly, tell me thy confession, and restore
thy humanity.</text>
<text id="47000400">Greetings. Well, I did'st not expect to find thee Hollow.</text>
<text id="47000401">But do not fear; I shall free thee from thy monstrous form.</text>
<text id="47000500">When thou art in need of humanity, thou shalt be welcome.</text>
<text id="47000501">I always have an ear for confession.</text>
<text id="47000502">Heh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="47000600">If thou commiteth a crime, bring thyself back here.</text>
<text id="47000601">There is no misdoing that I cannot undo!</text>
<text id="47000602">Keh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="47000700">Stocking up on Indictments? How honourable of you.</text>
<text id="47000701">Heh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="47000800">Thou art welcome anytime.</text>
<text id="47000801">It is only human to commit a sin...</text>
<text id="47000802">Heh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="47000900">Ooph!</text>
<text id="47000910">Hrgt!</text>
<text id="47000920">Arg!</text>
<text id="47000930">Oog!</text>
<text id="47000940">By the Lords!</text>
<text id="47001000">Thou hast made thyself clear.</text>
<text id="47001001">And thou leaveth me no choice.</text>
<text id="47001002">I shall accept thy next confession, in the hereafter!</text>
<text id="47001100">Thou shalt regret this...</text>
<text id="47001101">Fear thine indelible wrongdoings...</text>
<text id="47001200">Much trouble hast thou caus'd.</text>
<text id="47001201">Thou was weak in spirit, broken by the weight of thy sin.</text>
<text id="47001300">Greetings.</text>
<text id="47001301">I am Oswald of Carim, the pardoner.</text>
<text id="47001400">Thou art a friend. For thee, a warm welcome.</text>
<text id="47001401">Cometh thou to confess? Or to accuse? For indeed all sin is my
domain.</text>
<text id="47001500">Thou appearest to lack faith, yet magnanimous are the Gods.</text>
<text id="47001501">Cometh thou to confess? Or to accuse? For indeed all sin is my
domain.</text>
<text id="47001600">Good tidings, thou art welcome.</text>
<text id="47001601">Laudable is thy dedication to sin.</text>
<text id="47001700">Hmm...</text>
<text id="47001701">Hast thou acquaintance with Petrus of Thorolund?</text>
<text id="47001702">I wager you two hath likely found much in common.</text>
<text id="47001703">For is he not too drenched in sin...</text>
<text id="47001704">Heh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="48000000">Is it not so that thou art new.</text>
<text id="48000001">Thou fared well to find me.</text>
<text id="48000002">But cometh thee not for the grave of Sir Artorias?</text>
<text id="48000003">My advice true, forget this! </text>
<text id="48000004">The legend of Artorias art none but a fabrication.</text>
<text id="48000005">...Traversing the dark? 'Tis but a fairy tale.</text>
<text id="48000006">Have thine own respect, go not yonder knocking for nothing, I
say!</text>
<text id="48000100">Well indeed, thou art a strange one! Nevertheless, I feel some
liking for thee.</text>
<text id="48000101">I'm Alvina of the Darkroot Wood.</text>
<text id="48000102">I command a clan of hunters who track down defilers of the forest
graves.</text>
<text id="48000103">What dost thou say? Wilt thou not join us?</text>
<text id="48000104">Oh yes, I believe we would suit thee well.</text>
<text id="48000200">I am very glad!</text>
<text id="48000201">And now thou art one of us! Let us establish a Covenant.</text>
<text id="48000202">And here, taketh this ring.</text>
<text id="48000203">If thou weareth that ring, it allows for thine summoning.</text>
<text id="48000204">If mine senses reveal intruders, then I will summon thee.</text>
<text id="48000205">Fend them off sir, I beseech only this.</text>
<text id="48000206">I shall summon others, who will by their honour work tirelessly
with thee.</text>
<text id="48000207">Thou shalt receive great reward, and whatsoever ye shall pillage
will be thine own.</text>
<text id="48000208">A true agreement, not so?</text>
<text id="48000209">But thou must heed the golden rule...</text>
<text id="48000210">The clan is thine own family. To thine kinsmen forever stay true.</text>
<text id="48000211">Dare'st not in any attempt to double-cross. Have no doubt, such
wretchedness, never will we tolerate.</text>
<text id="48000300">Ah, thou dost cometh. How fares ye?</text>
<text id="48000301">My hopes for thee are of the highest. Do not such a hope shatter
with foul disproportion.</text>
<text id="48000302">Ah yes, here is thine reward. It is for thee, take it!</text>
<text id="48000303">Make no attempt to show thineself as Hollow!</text>
<text id="48000400">Oh, thou art present!</text>
<text id="48000401">Shiva hath spoken of thee. I like that which I hear!</text>
<text id="48000402">I have heard murmuring about thee. I like that which I hear!</text>
<text id="48000403">I felt of thou indeed as a special one!</text>
<text id="48000404">The very moment mine eyes first set upon thee.</text>
<text id="48000405">Here's a precious reward. It is for thee, take it.</text>
<text id="48000406">May thine skill earn thee many more!</text>
<text id="48000500">Oh, I see. 'Tis a pity indeed.</text>
<text id="48000501">But this is thine stubborn choice alone. I cannot enforce it upon
thee.</text>
<text id="48000502">If thine mind should be alter'd, forsooth speak to me once more.</text>
<text id="48000600">Oh, thou art here.</text>
<text id="48000601">Tell me thou hast thought on't once more and will join us?</text>
<text id="48000700">Hmm, I see. A result most heathenish and gross.</text>
<text id="48000701">Then there is nothing more to say about this tedious reckoning.</text>
<text id="48000702">Be gone from here. Pernicious caitiff.</text>
<text id="48000800">Dee hee hee, dee hee hee!</text>
<text id="48000801">What a fool we have, what a wretched fool we have!</text>
<text id="48000900">Oh, it is thee...</text>
<text id="48000901">Thine kinsmen are betrayed by thee. This doth bode most badly. </text>
<text id="48000902">No rest will ease thy rotten soul whilst there is one clansman
living...</text>
<text id="48000903">Forever tormented thou shalt be by our very howls...</text>
<text id="48000904">Hellish villain, thou hast used us most foully, thine own
family...</text>
<text id="48000905">For thee, no mercy shall be shown.</text>
<text id="48001000">Perchance...</text>
<text id="48001001">Hast thou met Shiva?</text>
<text id="48001002">A lad cometh from the far East, strong of arm; now a clan leader
of ours.</text>
<text id="48001003">...And yet...</text>
<text id="48001004">Still I feel that boy hides something. Of that I am certain.</text>
<text id="48001005">Small fear that he will use us badly...Yet on guard we must stay.</text>
<text id="48001006">And that man that clingeth to Shiva like some shadow...ensure
thou dost treat him with the same caution.</text>
<text id="52000000">...</text>
<text id="52000100">...</text>
<text id="55000000">You, you.</text>
<text id="55000001">Give me, warm.</text>
<text id="55000002">Give me, soft.</text>
<text id="55000100">You! You!</text>
<text id="55000101">Give me! Warm!</text>
<text id="55000102">Give me! Soft!</text>
<text id="55000200">No, no.</text>
<text id="55000201">That, no.</text>
<text id="55000202">That no warm.</text>
<text id="55000203">That no soft.</text>
<text id="55000300">No, no.</text>
<text id="55000301">Not that one.</text>
<text id="55000302">Enough, enough.</text>
<text id="56000000">...Mmn...ahh...</text>
<text id="56000010">...Aah...mmn...</text>
<text id="56000020">...Hmm...mm...</text>
<text id="56000100">...This may strike thine ear as somewhat peculiar, but...</text>
<text id="56000110">Long ago, in my homeland of Oolacile,
I was beset by a creature from the Abyss.</text>
<text id="56000120">I would have perished then,
were it not for the great knight Artorias.</text>
<text id="56000130">In truth, I saw little of what transpired,
for mine senses were already fled!</text>
<text id="56000140">But even still, there was something about Artorias...
A certain balance of the humours...</text>
<text id="56000150">...That quite perfectly fits your semblance.</text>
<text id="56000160">Heavens, could it be that...</text>
<text id="56000170">...</text>
<text id="56000180">Oh, dear me. That was Oolacile,
many centuries ago.</text>
<text id="56000190">Please excuse my fanciful musings. </text>
<text id="56000200">Excuse me for such whimsical utterances.</text>
<text id="56000210">Only, it was so very odd...</text>
<text id="56000220">You, and Artorias. I owe my life to each of you.
And both seem to share some resonance of sorts...</text>
<text id="56000230">Perhaps it is the nature of true greatness.</text>
<text id="56000300">I still think on that creature from the Abyss that preyed upon me.</text>
<text id="56000310">My faculties were far from lucid, but I quite clearly sensed certain emotions.</text>
<text id="56000320">A wrenching nostalgia, a lost joy, an object of obsession,
and a sincere hope to reclaim it...</text>
<text id="56000330">Could these thoughts belong to the beast from the Abyss?</text>
<text id="56000340">But if that were true, then perhaps it is no beast after all?</text>
<text id="56000350">Oh, please forgive my ramblings.</text>
<text id="56000360">It's just that, I wish to know the truth.</text>
<text id="56000370">And no one, not even loving Elizabeth, will tell me.</text>
<text id="56005000">Aah...</text>
<text id="56005010">Eek!</text>
<text id="57000000">...Whatever thou art, stay away...</text>
<text id="57000010">...Soon, I will be consumed...</text>
<text id="57000020">...By them, by the Dark...</text>
<text id="57000030">Oogh...</text>
<text id="57000040">Grrah!</text>
<text id="57000050">Hrgg, hrgggrah!</text>
<text id="57000100">...Thou art strong, human...</text>
<text id="57000110">...Surely thine kind are more than pure Dark...</text>
<text id="57000120">...I beg of thee...the spread of the Abyss...
...it must be stopped...</text>
<text id="57000130">Cough!</text>
<text id="57000140">...Ah, Sif, there you are, all of you...Forgive me...</text>
<text id="57000150">...For I have availed you nothing...</text>
<text id="57005000">Hrgg...</text>
<text id="57005010">Hrggraaah!</text>
<text id="57005020">Hrggraaah!</text>
<text id="57005100">Hrgkt!</text>
<text id="57005110">Ergkt!</text>
<text id="57005120">Hrgg!</text>
<text id="57005200">Hrggraaah!</text>
<text id="57005210">Hrggraaah!</text>
<text id="57005220">Hrggraaah!</text>
<text id="58000000">Hm? A visitor, have we?</text>
<text id="58000010">Thou must be the one who freed Artorias.</text>
<text id="58000020">An old friend he was, and thanks to thee...</text>
<text id="58000030">He left this world with honour intact.</text>
<text id="58000040">...And here I am, retired and blind.</text>
<text id="58000050">Of little help to thee, I am afraid.</text>
<text id="58000100">Well, thou hast come again. This is a surprise.</text>
<text id="58000200">Well, thou com'st again. Thou art a strange one.</text>
<text id="58000300">Good morrow...Is the Black Dragon posing thee duress?</text>
<text id="58000400">Yes, I thought as much.</text>
<text id="58000410">He is called Kalameet.</text>
<text id="58000420">A ferocious dragon indeed, even mighty Anor Londo dared not provoke his ire.</text>
<text id="58000430">I see little good coming from this, but...</text>
<text id="58000440">...Thy intent is to persevere... to the bitter end, hmm?</text>
<text id="58000500">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="58000510">Good, good. What is bravery, without a dash of recklessness!</text>
<text id="58000520">I have taken a liking to thee.</text>
<text id="58000530">And I owe thee much for thy service to Artorias.
Now watch, and see how Gough hunts dragons.</text>
<text id="58000540">Hrrmmm...</text>
<text id="58000550">Haah!</text>
<text id="58000560">Hah hah! Yes, a truer shot was never loosed!</text>
<text id="58000570">That bat will be grounded for a good spell!</text>
<text id="58000580">The rest is in thine hands. I await good tidings.</text>
<text id="58000590">Ahh, dragon slaying. Knighthood's highest calling...</text>
<text id="58000600">...Strange. I am rarely wrong on such matters...</text>
<text id="58000700">A wise choice. Why foist thyself unto the fiery maw?</text>
<text id="58000800">The Black Dragon troubles you yet, I see.</text>
<text id="58000900">...Hmm, yes, I see. I was mistaken...</text>
<text id="58001000">...Art thou prepared to challenge great Kalameet?</text>
<text id="58001100">Yes, surely that is best.</text>
<text id="58001200">Ah, hello there. What of Kalameet?</text>
<text id="58001210">He is an ancient dragon.
Skyward or no, he will not be put down easily.</text>
<text id="58001300">Why, thou hast defeated Kalameet!</text>
<text id="58001310">Wondrously played. Lord Gwyn's blessing upon thee.</text>
<text id="58001320">That beast will never take to the skies again.</text>
<text id="58001400">Farewell, human.</text>
<text id="58001410">Lead thy life as thou seest fit.</text>
<text id="58001500">Farewell, human.</text>
<text id="58001510">I await good tidings.</text>
<text id="58001600">Farewell, proud human.</text>
<text id="58001610">May every honour be bestowed upon thee.</text>
<text id="58001700">If thou seeketh to explore this domain, be wary of a black dragon.</text>
<text id="58001710">I fear thee no match for this terrible beast.</text>
<text id="58001800">I should confer...If thine was the blade to which Artorias fell.</text>
<text id="58001810">Then thou must be wary of Ciaran.</text>
<text id="58001820">She had strong feelings for the great Artorias.</text>
<text id="58001830">The poor, poor girl.</text>
<text id="58001900">Me?</text>
<text id="58001910">There is very little to be said.</text>
<text id="58001920">What good is a dog, with no hares to hunt?</text>
<text id="58001930">...I am lucky to be alive, I suppose.</text>
<text id="58002000">Now, do not mistake my words.</text>
<text id="58002010">I cherish my work. Wood carving is a nuanced art.</text>
<text id="58002020">I would have much to talk about with that blacksmith.</text>
<text id="58002030">In truth, how is the old chap, I wonder?</text>
<text id="58002040">Still hammering away, I should hope.</text>
<text id="58002100">The dragons shall never be forgotten...</text>
<text id="58002110">We knights fought valiantly, but for every one of them,
we lost three score of our own.</text>
<text id="58002120">Exhilaration, pride, hatred, rage...
The dragons teased out
our dearest emotions.</text>
<text id="58002130">...Thou will understand, one day.</text>
<text id="58002140">At thy twilight, old thoughts return, in great waves of nostalgia.</text>
<text id="58002200">Ahh, this Greatbow?</text>
<text id="58002210">I shan't need it, with no dragons to hunt.</text>
<text id="58002220">I know not if a human could even operate it, but here...</text>
<text id="58002230">Thy need outweighs mine.</text>
<text id="58002300">Hm? A visitor, have we?</text>
<text id="58002310">Thou must be the one who freed Artorias.</text>
<text id="58002320">An old friend he was, and thanks to thee...</text>
<text id="58002330">He left this world with honour intact.</text>
<text id="58002340">And I see that the great black dragon Kalameet is dusted by thine hand.</text>
<text id="58002350">Wondrously played. Lord Gwyn's blessing upon thee.</text>
<text id="58002360">I am retired, and blind.</text>
<text id="58002370">To receive a visit by one as lofty as thyself, is a great honour indeed.</text>
<text id="58002400">I see that thou hast dusted the great black dragon Kalameet.</text>
<text id="58002410">Wondrously played. Lord Gwyn's blessing upon thee.</text>
<text id="58002420">I see that there is at least one legend among ye humans.</text>
<text id="58002430">Dear me... That old bat will never fly again.</text>
<text id="58002500">Thou com'st again, legend of humans.</text>
<text id="58002510">It is always an honour to speak with thee.</text>
<text id="58002600">I suspect thou hast taken a gander at it,</text>
<text id="58002610">But the Dark of the Abyss, which swallowed poor Artorias,
threatens to devour our entire land of Oolacile.</text>
<text id="58002620">It seems that this dire fate is unavoidable.</text>
<text id="58002630">But, seduced by a Dark serpent or no,</text>
<text id="58002640">They awoke that thing themselves, and drove it mad.</text>
<text id="58002650">...One's demise is always one's own making.</text>
<text id="58002700">If thine wish is to succeed poor Artorias, and challenge the spread of the Dark,</text>
<text id="58002710">Then thou must face Manus, Father of the Abyss.</text>
<text id="58002720">The Dark emanates from Manus himself.</text>
<text id="58002730">Even if this land shall expire,
thou may be able to prevent further corrosion.</text>
<text id="58002740">...But even so, one day the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain.</text>
<text id="58002750">And even a legend such as thineself can do nothing to stop that.</text>
<text id="58005000">Cease this.</text>
<text id="58005010">Stop it, I say.</text>
<text id="58005020">Understand this. I wish thee no harm.</text>
<text id="58005030">Stop that!</text>
<text id="58005040">By the Gods!</text>
<text id="58005100">Ahh, so this is true human nature.</text>
<text id="58005110">Artorias is in your debt, but thou leavest me little choice...</text>
<text id="58005120">May you perish, for the good of all!</text>
<text id="58005200">Mmgraah!</text>
<text id="58005210">Mmgraah!</text>
<text id="58005220">Hahh...</text>
<text id="58005300">Oog!</text>
<text id="58005310">Ooph!</text>
<text id="58005320">Hrg!</text>
<text id="58005400">Arrgggg!</text>
<text id="58005410">Humans...hmph...</text>
<text id="58005420">What vile creatures...</text>
<text id="58006000">Hello</text>
<text id="58006001">Thank you</text>
<text id="58006002">Very good!</text>
<text id="58006003">I'm sorry!</text>
<text id="58006004">Help me!</text>
<text id="59000000">Hm...Oh, let me guess...</text>
<text id="59000010">Snatched by a shadowy limb,
and dragged off to the past?</text>
<text id="59000100">Yes, of course. Exactly what happened to me.</text>
<text id="59000110">We are both strangers in this strange land.</text>
<text id="59000120">But, at least now there are two of us.</text>
<text id="59000200">Oh, well, my mistake...</text>
<text id="59000210">But we are both travellers.</text>
<text id="59000220">We ought to help one another out.</text>
<text id="59000300">Oh, still alive, are you?</text>
<text id="59000310">Think of anything that you might need?</text>
<text id="59000400">Oh, for Juniper's sake.</text>
<text id="59000410">Put some spring into your step!</text>
<text id="59000420">Mwah hah hah!</text>
<text id="59000500">Oh, you again...</text>
<text id="59000510">What ever's the matter? No, I can tell. 
You need me more than ever.</text>
<text id="59000520">Mwah hah hah!</text>
<text id="59000600">So long.</text>
<text id="59000700">So long.</text>
<text id="59000710">...We'll be seeing each other...</text>
<text id="59000720">Gee hee hee!</text>
<text id="59000800">Did you happen across Knight Artorias?</text>
<text id="59000810">The legendary Abysswalker, from the old tales.</text>
<text id="59000820">...Well, if you haven't, it's just as well...</text>
<text id="59000830">He's a colourless sort, if you ask me.</text>
<text id="59000840">Mwah hah hah!</text>
<text id="59000900">Did you really slay Knight Artorias?</text>
<text id="59000910">I'd heard the Abyss found him first,
but even still...</text>
<text id="59000920">That's absolutely treacherous.</text>
<text id="59000930">Yes, magnificently so!</text>
<text id="59000940">Mwah hah hah!</text>
<text id="59001000">So, what did that giant mushroom make you do?</text>
<text id="59001010">Not that I care. It's none of my business.</text>
<text id="59001020">But I do wonder about those sorceries of hers...</text>
<text id="59001030">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="59001100">Hm? I've little to talk about, really.</text>
<text id="59001110">Oh, you know me. What do I know?</text>
<text id="59001120">Heh heh!</text>
<text id="59001200">What? If you've something to say, then say it!</text>
<text id="59001210">Just don't say the wrong thing...</text>
<text id="59001220">Heh heh heh!</text>
<text id="59001300">...Oh, you!</text>
<text id="59001310">You have quite some nerve. Or are you just thick?</text>
<text id="59001320">Fine, then. What is it that you need?</text>
<text id="59001400">I'll be seeing you.</text>
<text id="59001410">If you survive your travels...</text>
<text id="59001500">...Well, you've quite the nerve!</text>
<text id="59001510">I've had enough of you!</text>
<text id="59001600">Believe it or not,</text>
<text id="59001610">Oolacile has brought the Abyss upon itself.</text>
<text id="59001620">Fooled by that toothy serpent,
they upturned the grave of primeval man,
and incited his ornery wrath.</text>
<text id="59001630">What could they have been thinking?</text>
<text id="59001640">But to you and I, it's all ancient history.</text>
<text id="59001650">You have to ask yourself. Does it really matter?</text>
<text id="59001660">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="59005000">Oh! It's come to blows, has it?</text>
<text id="59005010">Fine, then. I've had enough of you, anyway!</text>
<text id="59005100">What now? You think this my fault?</text>
<text id="59005110">How very, very petty of you!</text>
<text id="59005120">Very petty, indeed!</text>
<text id="59005200">Ooph!</text>
<text id="59005210">Erg!</text>
<text id="59005220">Oww!</text>
<text id="59005230">That bloody hurts!</text>
<text id="59005300">There!</text>
<text id="59005310">Ah-hah, there!</text>
<text id="59005400">What? Now you're feeling the heat?</text>
<text id="59005410">You should have thought long and hard...</text>
<text id="59005420">Before you sided with a bloody mushroom!</text>
<text id="59005430">Nyah hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="59005500">You damn fool.</text>
<text id="59005510">I am Marvellous Chester! What did you expect?</text>
<text id="59005600">Hrrg...</text>
<text id="59005610">You win...please...</text>
<text id="59005620">Oh, please...have mercy...</text>
<text id="60000000">...Human...</text>
<text id="60000010">...Why have you the ring of Artorias?</text>
<text id="60000011">...Why have you the soul of Artorias?</text>
<text id="60000020">...I am Ciaran, and that is a keepsake.</text>
<text id="60000100">...That ring...</text>
<text id="60000110">It was purloined by a man in a long coat...</text>
<text id="60000120">I know not how you came upon it,</text>
<text id="60000130">but its owner met his death here.</text>
<text id="60000140">He was a dear companion,
and I wish to return the ring to his grave.</text>
<text id="60000150">Would you be willing to part with it?</text>
<text id="60000200">Thank you. You are very kind.</text>
<text id="60000210">Please take this. I no longer need it.</text>
<text id="60000220">May the Lord guide thee.</text>
<text id="60000300">Yes, of course...</text>
<text id="60000310">...</text>
<text id="60000320">...I must not be presumptuous.</text>
<text id="60000330">Artorias would not have approved.</text>
<text id="60000400">What is it? Something else?</text>
<text id="60000410">Have you changed your mind?</text>
<text id="60000500">...Then you have no business with me...</text>
<text id="60000600">...Are you human?</text>
<text id="60000610">...I forgive you.</text>
<text id="60000620">I am here to pay respects to a dear friend.</text>
<text id="60000630">Please, allow me a moment alone.</text>
<text id="60000700">...You, is that not...</text>
<text id="60000710">The soul of the man who fell on this spot?</text>
<text id="60000720">He was a dear friend. I wish to pay proper respect, with that soul.</text>
<text id="60000730">Would you be willing to part with it?</text>
<text id="60005000">Hmph, you humans...</text>
<text id="60005010">...always taking what you please.
Then, I shall do the same.</text>
<text id="60005011">...always resorting to force.
Then, I shall do the same.</text>
<text id="60005100">Hrk!</text>
<text id="60005110">Erg!</text>
<text id="60005120">Ooh!</text>
<text id="60005200">Hmph, such conceit...</text>
<text id="60005210">How did you imagine that
the Lord's Blade would not reach you?</text>
<text id="60005300">But, how...</text>
<text id="60005310">You humans...</text>
<text id="61000000">Well, look at this one.</text>
<text id="61000010">From what far-away age hast thou come?
Thy scent is very human, indeed.</text>
<text id="61000020">...But, not intolerable...</text>
<text id="61000030">Ah, Princess Dusk's saviour.
Thine aura is precisely as she described.</text>
<text id="61000031">Princess Dusk has spoken of thee.
Thy aura is precisely as she described.</text>
<text id="61000040">I thank thee deeply,
for rescuing Her Highness.</text>
<text id="61000050">But Princess Dusk is here no longer...</text>
<text id="61000060">...snatched away by that horrifying primeval human.</text>
<text id="61000070">And so I must ask...
Couldst thou once more play the saviour?</text>
<text id="61000100">Thank you.</text>
<text id="61000110">I am Elizabeth, guardian of this sanctuary.</text>
<text id="61000120">Something of a godmother to Princess Dusk.</text>
<text id="61000130">I shall assist thee, to my utmost.</text>
<text id="61000140">For I am one with the sorceries of Oolacile.</text>
<text id="61000200">Yes, I understand.</text>
<text id="61000210">We care dearly for Princess Dusk,
and are apt to blur our boundaries.</text>
<text id="61000220">I am ashamed to have been so imposing.</text>
<text id="61000230">But should thine heart be changed,
speak to me again.</text>
<text id="61000240">This sanctuary, and the sorceries of Oolacile,
are my domain.</text>
<text id="61000250">My strength could surely assist thee in thy travels.</text>
<text id="61000300">Hast thou reconsidered?</text>
<text id="61000310">Such that thou might rescue dear Dusk?</text>
<text id="61000400">Yes, yes, of course.</text>
<text id="61000410">But shouldst thine heart be changed,
speak to me again.</text>
<text id="61000500">Thank goodness thou art safe.</text>
<text id="61000510">What is thy wish? I offer thee my all.</text>
<text id="61000600">Struggling, are we?</text>
<text id="61000610">If there is anything I can do,
never hesitate to ask.</text>
<text id="61000700">I have awaited thee.
Thou hast rescued Princess Dusk,</text>
<text id="61000710">...and rid us of that terrible primeval human.
Even halting the spread of the Abyss!</text>
<text id="61000720">I salute the grandeur of thine enterprise.</text>
<text id="61000730">Please, allow me to express my gratitude.</text>
<text id="61000740">I thank thee... as do we all.</text>
<text id="61000800">May the flames guide thee.</text>
<text id="61000900">Thou shalt see further on.</text>
<text id="61000910">An abyss was begat of the ancient beast, 
and threatens to swallow the whole of Oolacile.</text>
<text id="61000920">Knight Artorias came to stop this,
but such a hero has nary a murmur of Dark.</text>
<text id="61000930">Without doubt, he will be swallowed by the Abyss,
overcome by its utter blackness.</text>
<text id="61000940">...Indeed, the Abyss may be unstoppable...</text>
<text id="61000950">Still I have faith, that Princess Dusk 
may be rescued yet...</text>
<text id="61001000">Thou art from a time far, far ahead.</text>
<text id="61001010">There are many things I wish to ask.</text>
<text id="61001020">...But I know that I must not.</text>
<text id="61001030">The perils of our time are overwhelming enough.</text>
<text id="61001100">Hah hah...Was thine eye, glancing hither?</text>
<text id="61001110">Thou needst not hide thy wonder.</text>
<text id="61001120">I am a mushroom, after all.</text>
<text id="61001130">Hee hee hee...</text>
<text id="61001200">Not long ago, I had another visitor.</text>
<text id="61001210">A human like thineself, from a far-away time.</text>
<text id="61001220">Only, he was dreadfully odious...</text>
<text id="61001230">And I am afraid that he is still amongst us.</text>
<text id="61001240">He wore a hat and a long black coat...</text>
<text id="61001300">I will remember thee,
but I will keep thy story to myself.</text>
<text id="61001310">This is the best way,
for thou art come from a time far ahead.</text>
<text id="61001320">No-one will sing thy praises,
but yet thy greatness shall live on.</text>
<text id="61001330">For it shall be my purpose,
to remember all thou hast done for us.</text>
<text id="61005000">Ah!</text>
<text id="61005010">Ooh!</text>
<text id="61005020">Aaah!</text>
<text id="61005030">Stop that!</text>
<text id="61005040">Please, no!</text>
<text id="61005050">Stop!</text>
<text id="61005100">Aiieeek!</text>
<text id="61005110">Aiieeegh!</text>
<text id="61005120">Ooh...aah...</text>
<text id="61005130">But, why... Why... Dear Dusk...</text>
<text id="62000000">...</text>
