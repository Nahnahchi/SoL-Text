<text id="511024">18. 	DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
THIS SECTION 18 APPLIES TO YOU ONLY IF YOU RESIDE IN NORTH, CENTRAL, AND SOUTH AMERICA, OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES.

If you are a resident of any nation of the Americas, other than the United States of America, either you or BNEA may refer any dispute relating to or arising from this Agreement or the Game to alternative dispute resolution (such as conciliation or arbitration) with the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Agreement will not prevent you from bringing any dispute or claim that may be subject to this Section 18: (i) to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from BNEA on your behalf; (ii) bringing against BNEA, in any court of competent jurisdiction, any claim that is not arbitrable or for which arbitration is prohibited or restricted by applicable law; or (iii) from bringing any claim before a small claims court, subject to the jurisdictional limitations and requirements of such small claims court.</text>
<text id="511025">19. 	DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
THIS SECTION 19 APPLIES TO YOU ONLY IF YOU RESIDE IN THE UNITED STATES.

If you are a resident of the United States of America, by accepting the terms of this Agreement, you and BNEA: (i) agree to resolve certain disputes through mandatory binding arbitration, as set forth in Section 19(a), and each subpart thereof (collectively, the “Arbitration Agreement”); and (ii) expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in any class action brought against the other party, pursuant to Section 19(b) (the “Class Action Waiver”); unless (iii) you exercise your right to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement and/or the Class Action Waiver, as set forth in Section 19(c).
a)	MANDATORY, BINDING ARBITRATION. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND BNEA: (i) ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND BNEA THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION, PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 19.a.iii) ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS BASED ON LEGAL THEORIES OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS INJURY, STATUTORY VIOLATIONS, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, RIGHTS OF PRIVACY, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND BNEA, ANY TERM OR PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE GAME (EACH, A “CLAIM”); (ii) EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIMS IN COURT OR TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS HEARD OR TRIED BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY; (iii) SHALL NOT BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY, EVEN IF OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT; AND (iv) SHALL NOT SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE OR COMBINE ANY ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIM BY YOU OR BNEA WITH ANY ACTION OR ARBITRATION BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST ANY THIRD PARTY, WITHOUT THE EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT OF EACH SUCH THIRD PARTY AND BOTH PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT. UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A PROPER OPT OUT NOTICE (IN STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 19(c)), YOU AND BNEA AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY WILL ONLY BE CONDUCTED THROUGH MANDATORY, BINDING ARBITRATION.
i)	Pre-Arbitration Informal Dispute Resolution. Prior to initiating arbitration of any Claim subject to this Arbitration Agreement, you and BNEA agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute or Claim between you and BNEA. The party seeking to raise such dispute or Claim shall send to the other party a written notice describing the nature and basis of such dispute or Claim and identifying the relief sought. All such written notices to BNEA must be sent via first class mail to: BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc., Attn: Legal &amp; Business Affairs Department, 2051 Mission College Blvd., Santa Clara, CA 95054, USA. If you and BNEA do not agree to resolve such dispute or Claim within 30 days after such written notice is received, the party seeking to raise such dispute or Claim may initiate an arbitration action against the other, as permitted by the Arbitration Agreement, above.
ii)	Arbitration Procedure. Arbitration is a legally-binding process, through which a party may seek legal remedies from or against another party, similar to a legal action brought before a court, but that generally imposes fewer strict procedural formalities, is held before a third party, neutral arbitrator (instead of before a judge or jury), provides for more limited discovery and potentially reduced legal fees for each party, and is subject to limited review by courts. The procedure for arbitration of any Claim under this Arbitration Agreement will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where applicable, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, both of which are available at: http://www.adr.org. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and BNEA agree that any such arbitration will be conducted in English, and permit the electronic submission of documents and allow participation by phone or by teleconference, or in person, at a mutually agreed location.
iii)	Excluded Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will not prevent you or BNEA from bringing any Claim: (i) to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies with the governmental authority and competent jurisdiction to seek relief on your or BNEA’s behalf, from the other party; or (ii) before a small claims court, subject to the jurisdictional limitations and requirements of such small claims court.
iv)	Severability of Arbitration Agreement. You and BNEA agree that, no provision of this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable against you or BNEA and all Claims shall be governed by Sections 20(a) and 21(a), below, in the event either: (i) a court of competent jurisdiction conclusively determines that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable, prohibited by applicable law, or inapplicable to any Claim; or (ii) you submit a proper Opt Out Notice (in compliance with Section 19(c)), wherein you have expressed your election to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
b)	CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, BY ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND BNEA HEREBY AGREE: (i) THAT EACH CLAIM IS PERSONAL TO YOU AND BNEA, AND SHALL ONLY BE CONDUCTED AS AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (OR AN INDIVIDUAL COURT PROCEEDING, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS EXCLUDED FROM THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO SECTION 19.a.iii) AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER FORM OF REPRESENTATIVE ACTION; (ii) EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS; AND (iii) THE ARBITRATOR (OR COURT, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS EXCLUDED FROM THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO SECTION 19.a.iii) MAY ONLY CONDUCT AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (OR COURT ACTION, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS EXCLUDED FROM THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO SECTION 19.a.iii), MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING RELATING TO SUCH CLAIMS. UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A PROPER OPT OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 19(c)), YOU AND BNEA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
i)	Severability of Class Action Waiver. You and BNEA agree that, no provision of this Class Action Waiver shall be enforceable against you or BNEA and all Claims shall be governed by Sections 20(a) and 21(a), below, in the event either: (i) a court of competent jurisdiction conclusively determines that any term or provision of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, prohibited by applicable law, or inapplicable to any Claim; or (ii) you submit a proper Opt Out Notice (in compliance with Section 19(c)), wherein you have elected to opt out of this Class Action Waiver. In no event may the severance of the Class Action Waiver be interpreted or deemed to constitute consent by you or BNEA to participate in a class action or class arbitration.
c)	OPT OUT PROCEDURE. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the foregoing Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver, by sending a written notice of your election to opt out from such Arbitration Agreement and/or Class Action Waiver (the “Opt Out Notice”), in strict compliance with the following requirements of Sections 19.c.i – 19.c.iii:

BNEA may use the foregoing information included in the Opt Out Notice to record, process, maintain, and administer your opting out of the Arbitration Agreement and/or Class Action Waiver, as applicable, but not for marketing purposes.
iv)	Effects of Proper Opt Out Notice. If your Opt Out Notice meets all of the above requirements, you and BNEA will be deemed to have opted out of the Arbitration Agreement and/or Class Action Waiver, subject to your statement in such Opt Out Notice, with respect to this Agreement. Submission of a valid Opt Out Notice applies only to Claims arising from or relating to the Game and Agreement identified therein, as between BNEA and the individual identified in such Opt Out Notice.
v)	Effects of Improper Opt Out Notice. If you submit an Opt Out Notice that fails to meet any of the requirements set forth in Sections 19.c.i – 19.c.iii, you and BNEA will be bound by the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver set forth in this Agreement.</text>

<text id="601024">18. 	DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
THIS SECTION 18 APPLIES TO YOU ONLY IF YOU RESIDE IN NORTH, CENTRAL, AND SOUTH AMERICA, OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES.

If you are a resident of any nation of the Americas, other than the United States of America, either you or BNEA may refer any dispute relating to or arising from this Agreement or the Game to alternative dispute resolution (such as conciliation or arbitration) with the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Agreement will not prevent you from bringing any dispute or claim that may be subject to this Section 18: (i) to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from BNEA on your behalf; (ii) bringing against BNEA, in any court of competent jurisdiction, any claim that is not arbitrable or for which arbitration is prohibited or restricted by applicable law; or (iii) from bringing any claim before a small claims court, subject to the jurisdictional limitations and requirements of such small claims court.</text>
<text id="601025">19. 	DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
THIS SECTION 19 APPLIES TO YOU ONLY IF YOU RESIDE IN THE UNITED STATES.

If you are a resident of the United States of America, by accepting the terms of this Agreement, you and BNEA: (i) agree to resolve certain disputes through mandatory binding arbitration, as set forth in Section 19(a), and each subpart thereof (collectively, the “Arbitration Agreement”); and (ii) expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in any class action brought against the other party, pursuant to Section 19(b) (the “Class Action Waiver”); unless (iii) you exercise your right to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement and/or the Class Action Waiver, as set forth in Section 19(c).
a)	MANDATORY, BINDING ARBITRATION. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND BNEA: (i) ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND BNEA THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION, PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 19.a.iii) ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS BASED ON LEGAL THEORIES OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS INJURY, STATUTORY VIOLATIONS, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, RIGHTS OF PRIVACY, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND BNEA, ANY TERM OR PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE GAME (EACH, A “CLAIM”); (ii) EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIMS IN COURT OR TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS HEARD OR TRIED BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY; (iii) SHALL NOT BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY, EVEN IF OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT; AND (iv) SHALL NOT SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE OR COMBINE ANY ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIM BY YOU OR BNEA WITH ANY ACTION OR ARBITRATION BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST ANY THIRD PARTY, WITHOUT THE EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT OF EACH SUCH THIRD PARTY AND BOTH PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT. UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A PROPER OPT OUT NOTICE (IN STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 19(c)), YOU AND BNEA AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY WILL ONLY BE CONDUCTED THROUGH MANDATORY, BINDING ARBITRATION.
i)	Pre-Arbitration Informal Dispute Resolution. Prior to initiating arbitration of any Claim subject to this Arbitration Agreement, you and BNEA agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute or Claim between you and BNEA. The party seeking to raise such dispute or Claim shall send to the other party a written notice describing the nature and basis of such dispute or Claim and identifying the relief sought. All such written notices to BNEA must be sent via first class mail to: BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc., Attn: Legal &amp; Business Affairs Department, 2051 Mission College Blvd., Santa Clara, CA 95054, USA. If you and BNEA do not agree to resolve such dispute or Claim within 30 days after such written notice is received, the party seeking to raise such dispute or Claim may initiate an arbitration action against the other, as permitted by the Arbitration Agreement, above.
ii)	Arbitration Procedure. Arbitration is a legally-binding process, through which a party may seek legal remedies from or against another party, similar to a legal action brought before a court, but that generally imposes fewer strict procedural formalities, is held before a third party, neutral arbitrator (instead of before a judge or jury), provides for more limited discovery and potentially reduced legal fees for each party, and is subject to limited review by courts. The procedure for arbitration of any Claim under this Arbitration Agreement will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where applicable, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, both of which are available at: http://www.adr.org. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and BNEA agree that any such arbitration will be conducted in English, and permit the electronic submission of documents and allow participation by phone or by teleconference, or in person, at a mutually agreed location.
iii)	Excluded Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will not prevent you or BNEA from bringing any Claim: (i) to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies with the governmental authority and competent jurisdiction to seek relief on your or BNEA’s behalf, from the other party; or (ii) before a small claims court, subject to the jurisdictional limitations and requirements of such small claims court.
iv)	Severability of Arbitration Agreement. You and BNEA agree that, no provision of this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable against you or BNEA and all Claims shall be governed by Sections 20(a) and 21(a), below, in the event either: (i) a court of competent jurisdiction conclusively determines that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable, prohibited by applicable law, or inapplicable to any Claim; or (ii) you submit a proper Opt Out Notice (in compliance with Section 19(c)), wherein you have expressed your election to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
b)	CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, BY ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND BNEA HEREBY AGREE: (i) THAT EACH CLAIM IS PERSONAL TO YOU AND BNEA, AND SHALL ONLY BE CONDUCTED AS AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (OR AN INDIVIDUAL COURT PROCEEDING, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS EXCLUDED FROM THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO SECTION 19.a.iii) AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER FORM OF REPRESENTATIVE ACTION; (ii) EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS; AND (iii) THE ARBITRATOR (OR COURT, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS EXCLUDED FROM THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO SECTION 19.a.iii) MAY ONLY CONDUCT AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (OR COURT ACTION, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS EXCLUDED FROM THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO SECTION 19.a.iii), MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING RELATING TO SUCH CLAIMS. UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A PROPER OPT OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 19(c)), YOU AND BNEA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
i)	Severability of Class Action Waiver. You and BNEA agree that, no provision of this Class Action Waiver shall be enforceable against you or BNEA and all Claims shall be governed by Sections 20(a) and 21(a), below, in the event either: (i) a court of competent jurisdiction conclusively determines that any term or provision of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, prohibited by applicable law, or inapplicable to any Claim; or (ii) you submit a proper Opt Out Notice (in compliance with Section 19(c)), wherein you have elected to opt out of this Class Action Waiver. In no event may the severance of the Class Action Waiver be interpreted or deemed to constitute consent by you or BNEA to participate in a class action or class arbitration.
c)	OPT OUT PROCEDURE. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the foregoing Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver, by sending a written notice of your election to opt out from such Arbitration Agreement and/or Class Action Waiver (the “Opt Out Notice”), in strict compliance with the following requirements of Sections 19.c.i – 19.c.iii:
i)	Form &amp; Address. Your Opt Out Notice must be sent to the following address: BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc., ATTN: Legal &amp; Business Affairs, 2051 Mission College Blvd., Santa Clara, CA 95054, USA, and either by: (i) first class mail, postage prepaid, certified and return receipt requested; or (ii) overnight courier service (such as Federal Express).
ii)	Time Limitations. Unless a longer period is required by applicable law, your Opt Out Notice must be postmarked (if sent by first class mail) or deposited (if sent by overnight courier service) within: (i) 30 days of your purchase of your copy of the Game; or (ii) if no purchase was made, then within 30 days of the date on which you first accessed or used your copy of the Game.
iii)	Required Information.

BNEA may use the foregoing information included in the Opt Out Notice to record, process, maintain, and administer your opting out of the Arbitration Agreement and/or Class Action Waiver, as applicable, but not for marketing purposes.
iv)	Effects of Proper Opt Out Notice. If your Opt Out Notice meets all of the above requirements, you and BNEA will be deemed to have opted out of the Arbitration Agreement and/or Class Action Waiver, subject to your statement in such Opt Out Notice, with respect to this Agreement. Submission of a valid Opt Out Notice applies only to Claims arising from or relating to the Game and Agreement identified therein, as between BNEA and the individual identified in such Opt Out Notice.
v)	Effects of Improper Opt Out Notice. If you submit an Opt Out Notice that fails to meet any of the requirements set forth in Sections 19.c.i – 19.c.iii, you and BNEA will be bound by the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver set forth in this Agreement.</text>
