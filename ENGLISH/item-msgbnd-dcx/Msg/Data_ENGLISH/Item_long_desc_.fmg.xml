<text id="2001">Opens the narrow passage leading below

the Undead Burg.

The lower Undead Burg is a treacherous place.
Do not turn your back on the wily thieves, or
the wild dogs who serve the Capra Demon.</text>
<text id="2002">This crest opens a door in the
Darkroot Garden sealed by ancient magic.

The door leads to the grave of Sir Artorias
the Abysswalker. Many adventurers have left
for the grave, but none have returned,
for they make easy prey for local bandits.
With such dangers, the crest can do more harm
than good in the hands of the uninitiated.</text>
<text id="2003">Key to the hanging cage in Sen's Fortress.

If a hapless adventurer becomes fatigued
during an imprudent attempt to overcome the
fortress, the serpent men will not kill him,
but lock him up in a lonely cage.
Eventually, unless they have forgotten,
they drag the victim off to who-knows-where.</text>
<text id="2004">Key to the cell of the Duke's Archive Tower.

The Archive Tower, once a trove of precious
tomes and letters, became a prison after the
onset of Seath's madness. The serpent men
who guard the prison know not the value of
what they hide. In the basement of the tower
are the writhing "mistakes" of the terrifying
experiments which were conducted there.</text>
<text id="2005">Key to the giant door leading out from
the uppermost floor of Archive Tower,
which now serves as a prison.

The key's design resembles not the key of a

</text>
<text id="2006">Key to the giant cell below the Duke's

The giant cell once imprisoned countless

sanity, as the horde of "mistakes" writhe
at a fearfully close proximity.</text>
<text id="2007">Key to Blighttown from the Depths of the
Undead Burg. Swallowed by the Gaping Dragon.

As its name suggests, Blighttown is a place
of great pestilence. Even the polluted
inhabitants of the Depths are aware of its
dangers, and built this mighty door in hopes
that they could remain safely separated.</text>
<text id="2008">Key to the iron bars separating the ruins of
New Londo and Drake Valley.

The ruins of New Londo were blocked off,
for the cursed ghosts posed danger to life

</text>
<text id="2013">Key to the floodgates of New Londo, which
seal away the Four Kings who fell to Dark.

The Sealers flooded New Londo to banish

The agonizing decision was made with the

robust culture of the city, would be lost.
The victims now roam the ruins as ghosts.</text>
<text id="2014">Key opening the door from the lower

Those banished from the Undead Burg eke out

<text id="2016">Key to the iron bars on the west side of the

The Undead Asylum is a giant Undead prison,

But even if a hero found a key in Lordran
to liberate this prison, would he have the
means, or the heart, to ever come back?
</text>
<text id="2017">The purpose of this key is unknown.
It appears to be a basic prison cell key.</text>
<text id="2018">Key to the sewer chamber in the Depths.

In any community, a few bad apples are sure

turned Undead, and banished to the Depths,
would they reconsider their ways?

Use this key to see for yourself.
</text>
<text id="2019">Key to the basement of the watchtower in
the Undead Burg.

The basement of the watchtower forms a stone
cell. There are rumors of a hero turned
Hollow who was locked away by a dear friend.
For his own good, of course.</text>
<text id="2020">Extra key to a cell in the
Duke's Archive Tower.

Perhaps the serpent men were careless,
for there are several keys scattered
about which fit Archive Tower cells.</text>
<text id="2021">Key to a residence in the Undead Burg.
Simple, sturdy design of the locks in
the Burg keep out unwanted visitors.

But this is a standard key in these parts,

The grooves of the crest are enchanted,
the door sealed with a powerful spell.</text>

A fragment of a Lord Soul discovered
